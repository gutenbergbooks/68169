<h1>SIR JOHN DERING</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PROLOGUE">PROLOGUE</h2>

</div>

<p>The light of guttering candles fell upon the two
small-swords where they lay, the one glittering
brightly, the other its murderous steel horribly bent
and dimmed; and no sound to hear except a whisper
of stirring leaves beyond the open window and the
ominous murmur of hushed voices from the inner
chamber.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door of this chamber opened and
a man appeared, slender, youthful and superlatively
elegant from curled peruke to buckled shoes, a young
exquisite who leaned heavily, though gracefully, in
the doorway, glancing back over his shoulder while
the slim fingers of one white hand busied themselves
to button his long, flowered waistcoat and made a
mighty business of it.</p>

<p>“Dead?” he questioned at last in a tone high-pitched
and imperious. “Dead ... is he?”</p>

<p>Receiving an affirmative answer, his lounging figure
grew tense and, turning his head, he stared at the
guttering candles.</p>

<p>Wide eyes that glared in the deathly pale oval of a
youthful face, pallid lips compressed above a jut of
white chin, nostrils that quivered with every breath,
sweat that trickled unheeded beneath the trim curls
of his great periwig; a face that grew aged even as
he stood there. Presently, with step a little uncertain,
he crossed to the open lattice and leaned to stare out
and up into the deepening night-sky, and yet was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
conscious that the others had followed him, men who
whispered, held aloof from him and peered back
toward that quiet inner chamber; and, with his wide
gaze still upturned to the sombre heaven, he spoke
in the same high, imperious tone:</p>

<p>“He died scarce ... ten minutes ago, I think?”</p>

<p>“Aye, thereabouts, sir,” answered the surgeon,
wiping podgy hands upon a towel. “I did all that was
possible, but he was beyond human aid when I arrived.
Æsculapius himself——”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes!... I wonder where is now the
merry soul of him?... He died attempting a laugh,
you’ll remember, sirs!”</p>

<p>“And thereby hastened his end, sir,” added the
surgeon; “the hæmorrhage——”</p>

<p>“Aye ... aye,” quavered young Mr. Prescott.
“Lord ... O Lord, Dering—he laughed ... and
his blood all a-bubbling ... laughed—and died ...
O Lord!”</p>

<p>“’Twas all so demned sudden!” exclaimed Captain
Armitage—“so curst sudden and unexpected, Dering.”</p>

<p>“And that’s true enough!” wailed Lord Verrian.
“’S life, Dering, you were close engaged afore we had
a chance to part ye!”</p>

<p>“To be sure I ... have pinked my man!” retorted
Sir John Dering a little unsteadily and with so wild a
look that Lord Verrian started.</p>

<p>“Nay, Dering,” quoth he soothingly. “’Twas he
drew first ... and you’d scarce made a push at each
other—and both o’ ye desperate fierce—than poor
Charles slips, d’ye see, and impales himself on your
point ... a devilish business altogether—never saw
such hell-fire fury and determination!”</p>

<p>“I’ faith, my lord,” answered Sir John, dabbing
daintily at pallid lips with belaced handkerchief,
“to hear you one might imagine that ... Charles
and I were ... the bitterest enemies i’ the world
rather than the ... best o’ friends—aye, the best!
For it seems ... a man may love a man and ...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
kill a man. So in yonder room lieth my poor friend
Charles, very still and silent, freed o’ debts and duns
at last, and I——” Sir John checked suddenly as
from the stairs without stole a ripple of laughter.</p>

<p>“By God—a woman!” gasped Lord Verrian.
Young Mr. Prescott sank down into the nearest chair,
head between twitching hands; Captain Armitage
sprang to bar the door, but, as he did so, it swung
open and a girl smiled in upon them—a tall, handsome
creature, black-eyed, full-lipped, dominant in her
beauty.</p>

<p>“Lord, gentlemen!” she exclaimed, glancing swiftly
from one face to another; “I protest y’are very gloomily
mum—as I were a ghost. Nay—what is it? Are
you all dumb? Where is Charles?... He was to
meet me here! You, my Lord Verrian ... Captain
Armitage—where is Charles?”</p>

<p>Lord Verrian turned his back, mumbling incoherencies;
Mr. Prescott groaned. And then her quick
glance had caught the glitter of the swords upon the
table. “Charles!” she cried suddenly. “Charles!
Ah—my God!”</p>

<p>Captain Armitage made a feeble effort to stay her,
but, brushing him imperiously aside, she fled into the
inner room.</p>

<p>Ensued a moment of tense and painful stillness,
and then upon the air rose a dreadful strangled screaming,
and she was back, the awful sound still issuing
from her quivering lips.</p>

<p>“Who ... who,” she gasped at last, “which of
you ... which of you ... did it?”</p>

<p>No one spoke, only Sir John Dering bowed, laced
handkerchief to lip.</p>

<p>“You—ah, ’twas you?” she questioned in hoarse
whisper. “I ... do not know you.... Your name,
sir?”</p>

<p>“I am called John Dering, madam.”</p>

<p>“Dering,” she repeated in the same tense voice—“John
Dering—I shall not forget! And ’twas you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
killed him—’twas you murdered my Charles—you—you?”</p>

<p>And now she broke out into a wild farrago of words,
bitter reproaches and passionate threats, while Sir
John stood immobile, head bowed, laced handkerchief
to lip, mute beneath the lash of her tongue. Softly,
stealthily, one by one, the others crept from the room
until the twain were alone, unseen, unheard, save by
one beyond the open casement who stood so patiently
in the gathering dusk, watching Sir John’s drooping
figure with such keen anxiety.</p>

<p>“... God curse you!” she panted hoarsely.
“God’s curse on you for the murderer you are! Aye,
but you shall suffer for it, I swear! You shall rue this
night’s work to the end of your life——” The passionate
voice broke upon a gasping sob, and then Sir John
spoke, his head still bowed:</p>

<p>“True, madam, I shall ... suffer and grieve for
this ... to the end o’ my days for ... Charles was
... my friend——”</p>

<p>“And you are his murderer, John Dering—so am I
your enemy!” she cried. “Your sin may be soon
forgot—the world may forgive you—even God may,
but I—never will! My vengeance shall follow you,
to end only with your last breath——”</p>

<p>Sir John coughed suddenly, the handkerchief at
his mouth became all at once horribly crimson, and,
sinking to his knees, he swayed over sideways; lying
thus, it chanced that the long, embroidered waistcoat
he had so vainly sought to button, fell open, discovering
the great and awful stains below.</p>

<p>For a moment the girl stood rigid, staring down at
the serene but death-pale face at her feet; and then
the door swung violently open to admit a very tall
man who ran to kneel and lift that slender form, to
chafe the nerveless hands and drop hot tears upon
the pallid cheek.</p>

<p>“John, John.... O John.... O lad—is this the
end——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>Sir John Dering’s eyes opened, and he stared up
into the square, bronzed face above him with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>“Hector ... is’t you, Hector?” he whispered.
“Tell her ... the lady ... that I think ... her
vengeance will end ... to-night! Which is ...
very well—”</p>

<p>“Woman,” cried the man Hector, lifting agonised
face, “if ye be true woman run for the surgeon quick,
ere he die!”</p>

<p>“Die?” she echoed. “Aye—’twere better he died,
far better for him—and for me!” So saying, she
turned and sped from the room, laughing wildly as
she ran.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">WHICH INTRODUCES THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Sir John Dering, at loss for a rhyme, paused
in the throes of composition to flick a speck of
dust from snowy ruffle, to glance from polished floor to
painted ceiling, to survey his own reflection in the
mirror opposite, noting with a critical eye all that
pertained to his exquisite self, the glossy curls of his
great, black periwig, the graceful folds of full-skirted,
embroidered coat, his sleek silk stockings and dainty,
gold-buckled shoes; and discovering naught in his
resplendent person to cavil at, turned back to his
unfinished manuscript, sighing plaintively.</p>

<p>“‘Soul’!” he murmured; “a damnable word, so
many rhymes to’t and none of ’em apt! Roll, coal,
hole, foal, goal, pole ... a devilish word! Mole,
shoal, vole—pish!”</p>

<p>It was at this precise juncture that the latch behind
him was lifted softly and upon the threshold stood
a man whose height and breadth seemed to fill the
doorway, a man whose hard-worn clothes were dusty
with travel, whose long, unkempt periwig, set somewhat
askew, framed a lean, brown face notable for
a pair of keen, blue eyes and the fierce jut of brow,
cheek-bone and jaw: a shabby person, indeed, and very
much at odds with the dainty luxury of the chamber
before him.</p>

<p>Thus, Hector MacLean, or more properly, General
Sir Hector Lauchlan MacLean, six foot four of Highland
Scot, having surveyed painted walls, polished floor and
frescoed ceiling, folded mighty arms, scowled at Sir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
John’s shapely, unconscious back and emitted a sound
that none but a true-born Scot may ever achieve.</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” exclaimed Hector MacLean;
whereupon Sir John started, dropped his quill and was
upon his feet all in a moment, modish languor and
exquisite affectations all forgotten in eager welcome.</p>

<p>“Hector!” he exclaimed, grasping the Scot’s two
bony fists; “Hector man, what should bring you all
the way to Paris—and me—after all this time?”</p>

<p>“Four years, John, four years and mair!” nodded
Sir Hector. “Four years and they might be eight,
judging by y’r looks. Lad, I’d hardly know ye ...
sic a mighty fine gentleman an’ sae pale——”</p>

<p>“A delicate pallor is the mode, Hector,” smiled Sir
John. “But what brings you to Paris?”</p>

<p>“Aye—what, John?” retorted Sir Hector, with a
dour shake of the head. “Who but yourself! What’s
all this I’m hearing concerning ye, John?”</p>

<p>“Evil beyond a doubt, Hector—evil, I’ll wager.
But ’tis no reason you should stand and scowl when
you might sit and smile like the old friend you are——”</p>

<p>“Aye, always your friend, lad, if ’twere only for
your father’s sake!”</p>

<p>“And mine also, I hope, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Aye, John, though you’re no the man your father
was!”</p>

<p>“I know it, Hector.”</p>

<p>“And ’tis memory o’ him and the promise I made
him to be ever mindful o’ your welfare hath brought
me these weary miles to Parus——”</p>

<p>“And since you are here, you shall stay with me,
Hector. Egad, ’twill be like old times!”</p>

<p>“No, no, John,” sighed MacLean, glancing round the
luxurious apartment; “you’ve grown too fine for me,
these days! My dusty claes wad foul your dainty
chairs and silken cushions. No, no, lad, you’re
become too grand a gentleman for a poor, rough, old
soldier——”</p>

<p>“Tush and a fiddlestick!” exclaimed Sir John,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
forcing him down into the nearest chair. “My home
is yours whenever you will, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Hame, John?” retorted MacLean. “Hame, d’ye
call it? Look at this room—all silken fripperies like
a leddy’s boudoir.... And talkin’ o’ ladies—look
up yonder!”—and he stabbed a bony finger at the
painted ceiling where nude dryads sported against
a flowery background. “Aye ... obsairve ’em!”
snorted MacLean, forsaking precise English for broad
Scots—a true sign of mental perturbation. “Gude
sakes, regaird yon painted besoms wi’ ne’er a clout tae
cover ’em—’tis no’ a sicht for decent eyes!”</p>

<p>“They were done by a famous painter, Hector, and
represent the three Graces——”</p>

<p>“Dis-graces, I ca’ ’em! Man, they’re ... fair
owerpowerin’!”</p>

<p>“Then don’t heed ’em, Hector; regard me instead.”</p>

<p>“Yourself, is it?” sighed MacLean. “O man,
there’s enough o’ lace an’ broidery aboot ye tae rig
oot a’ three o’ y’r dis-graces frae top tae tae. Ah,
Johnnie lad, when I obsairve a’ y’r finery o’ claes an’
mind hoo y’r father was dressed the day he panted
his life oot in my arrms wi’ a French bayonet in
his wame ... an auld tattered sairvice coat....
Aweel, aweel, he was a man, John ... dead before
you were old enough to ken him, mair’s the peety
... aye, mair’s the peety. An’ to-day, lad, here’s
me wi’ ane fut i’ the grave, and here’s yersel’ vera
prone tae a’ manner o’ follies an’ sic by reason as
you’re wilfu’ and over-young——”</p>

<p>“I’m twenty-seven, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Aye, a wilfu’ bairn, John, and a’m an auld man
ill able tae cope wi’ ye, laddie, bein’ vera feeble and
bowed wi’ years.”</p>

<p>“Sink me, Hector, but you’re strong as a horse
and straight as your sword, and can’t be a day older
than fifty-five or six——”</p>

<p>“Feefty-ane, John, fifty-one, whateffer! But I
was ever a quiet, plain, simple body tae follow the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
skirl o’ the war-pipes ... battle, skirmish an’ siege
... juist a puir, God-fearin’ soger-body——”</p>

<p>“Though King William made you a knight and a
General, Sir Hector!”</p>

<p>“Och aye ... but best of a’—I was y’r father’s
friend, his comrade an’ brither-in-arms in camp an’
field, y’ ken!” Sir Hector was silent a moment;
when next he spoke, his English was more precise than
usual. “When your noble father died, John, he left
you and your mother to my care.... So soon as
the wars were over I hasted to take up this sacred
charge and found your mother dying ... but you
were alive enough—a bonnie, braw, wee thing....
And since then, John, since then——”</p>

<p>“You have been everything to me, Hector—my
only true friend!”</p>

<p>“God knoweth I have tried to be faithful to the
trust, to keep my word to your father and do my duty
by his son——”</p>

<p>“And, sir, indeed you have!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but have I, John—have I so, indeed? Have
I trained you up to be the honourable gentleman your
father would have been proud of calling son? Have
I, lad—have I?”</p>

<p>“I trust so, sir.”</p>

<p>“And yet, John—and yet——” Sir Hector rose,
his grim lips twitching strangely, and began to pace
the floor in sudden agitation. Now, as he turned, it
chanced that the scabbard of his long, broad-bladed
Andrea Ferrara swept a dainty Sèvres ornament to
the floor, whereupon he halted to stare down at the
fragments with eyes of horrified dismay.</p>

<p>“Forgi’e me, John, forgi’e me!” he exclaimed,
unheeding Sir John’s reassurances; “but ye see, lad,
a’m no juist the man tae be trusted amang sic dainty
trifles as yon. Look at it—shivered beyond repair
... ’tis like a man’s honour! An’ talking of honour,
John, your father was a noble gentleman, proud of
his honourable name, who kept that name unsullied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
all his days.... Have you done as much, John? O lad,
you that are my dead friend’s son, you that I have
bred from your youth up—have you done as much?”</p>

<p>“Do you doubt it, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I do, John. God help me, I must—unless
report lies.”</p>

<p>Sir John’s pale cheek flushed, his sensitive nostrils
quivered, but his air and tone were placid as usual
when he spoke:</p>

<p>“To what do you refer, Hector?”</p>

<p>“To your wild doings and devilments, John, your
godless life and riotous wickedness, your hell-fire and
damnable practices generally——”</p>

<p>“Sit down, Hector. Pray sit down and fetch your
breath,” smiled Sir John. “Egad, you’re so full o’
news concerning me that ’tis plain you have met some
friend o’ mine of late——”</p>

<p>“Look’ee, John, scarce have I set foot in Parus
than I hear some scurrilous tale o’ yourself and some
Marquise or other——”</p>

<p>“Ah, the Marquise?” sighed Sir John, turning to
glance at his unfinished composition. “I was inditing
an ode to her, but my muse halted for an apt rhyme to
‘soul,’ Hector.”</p>

<p>“’Twas a curst discreditable affair as I heard it,
John!”</p>

<p>“Why, to be sure, Hector, my affairs are always
discreditable. But the scandal being well-nigh a
week old begins to grow stale, and the Marquise will be
out o’ the public eye already, poor soul, unless she
hath contrived some scheme to revive it, and she’s a
clever creature, on my soul she is—ah, and that
reminds me! What the deuce rhymes with ‘soul,’
Hector? There’s roll and poll and dole and goal
and——”</p>

<p>“Hoot-toot, man!” exclaimed MacLean. “The
de’il awa’ wi’ y’r rhymes!”</p>

<p>“With all my heart, Hector, for they’re bad enough,
I fear,” sighed Sir John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>“Sic sinfu’ repoorts as I’ve been hearin’ o’ ye,
John!” exclaimed MacLean, striding up and down the
room again. “Sic a gallimaufry o’ waefu’ wickedness,
sic lug-tingling tales.... O man, John, y’r reputation
fair stinks!”</p>

<p>“It does, Hector!” nodded Sir John placidly.
“Indeed, ’tis a reputation I find something hard to
maintain and live up to—though I do my best——”</p>

<p>“Your best, whateffer? Aye, wi’ your gamblin’,
your duellin’ an’ your fine French hussies—like this
Marquise—a feckless body and shameless——”</p>

<p>“And therefore fashionable, Hector! Remember,
this is Paris!”</p>

<p>“Parus!” snorted MacLean; “O Parus! Edinb’ro’s
a sinfu’ town, forbye it hath its savin’ graces.
Lon’non’s waur, but—Parus! Man, I’m no’ an archangel,
y’ ken, but—Parus! And this brings me back
tae yoursel’, John.”</p>

<p>“And pray what have you heard concerning me
particularly, Hector? Come, what are my latest
sins? Whose wife have I lured from sorrowing spouse?
What young innocent is my latest victim? What
hopeful youth have I ruined at the gaming-table?...
and in heaven’s name—smile, man!”</p>

<p>“How, smile is it, and my heart waefu’ for ye,
lad? Repoort speaks ye a very deevil, John.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but even the devil is never so black as he is
painted, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Ha, will ye be for tellin’ me repoort hath lied,
John?”</p>

<p>“Let us rather say it hath not spoke truth.”</p>

<p>“Whaur’s the differ, lad?”</p>

<p>“Report, Hector, doth trumpet me forth a very
monster of politely-vicious depravity. I am Sin
manifest, perambulating Iniquity. Do I sit me down
to the gaming-table I am bound to ruin some poor
wretch, do I but kiss a woman’s finger-tips she is forthwith
a mark for every scandalous tongue. My sins,
Hector, be all superlative and very pertinaciously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
come home to roost. Egad, I befoul my own nest
with a persistency that amazes me! But then, it
seems some are born to iniquity, some achieve iniquity,
and some have iniquity thrust upon ’em——”</p>

<p>“How so, John lad, what d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“That I have an enemy—nay two, rather! The
one being myself—and he is bad enough o’ conscience—but
the other—ah, Hector, this other one is more
implacable, more unrelenting and a thousand times
more merciless!”</p>

<p>“Who is he, lad, a God’s name?”</p>

<p>“’Tis no he,” sighed Sir John.</p>

<p>“Aha!” exclaimed Sir Hector, coming to an abrupt
stand; “you mean—her?”</p>

<p>“I do, Hector! ’Tis an ill thing to have an enemy,
but if that enemy be a woman, young, beautiful, of
high estate and very wealthy—the situation becomes
desperate.”</p>

<p>“A wumman!” repeated Sir Hector, rasping thumb
and finger across bony chin. “You mean ‘the Barrasdaile,’
of course, John?”</p>

<p>“Aye, the Lady Herminia Barrasdaile.”</p>

<p>“To be sure I mind weel how she raved and vowed
vengeance on ye, lad, the night Charles Tremayne
was killed——”</p>

<p>“Poor, reckless Charles ... I can see him now,
Hector, as he laughed ... and died——”</p>

<p>“Tush, laddie, forget it! ’Twas he drew first, and
himsel’ no better than——”</p>

<p>“He is dead, Hector! Sometimes I’ve thought
you had been wiser, kinder, to have let me die also,
rather than ha’ dragged me back to this emptiness
we call ‘life’——”</p>

<p>“Emptiness, laddie? Hoot-toot—and yersel’ the
joy o’ the leddies, the envy o’ the men! ‘The glass o’
fashion an’ mould o’ form,’ wi’ every young sprig o’
gallantry to copy the cut o’ your waistcoats? And
you think, John, you think that my Lady Barrasdaile
is actually carrying her threat into execution?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>“Well, these last few years, Hector, have proved
singularly eventful to me one way or another. I
have been involved so often in so many unsavoury
affairs and had so many duels forced upon me that my
reputation is grown a little threadbare, as you know,
and myself notorious.”</p>

<p>“And now it seems you’ve another duel on your
hands.”</p>

<p>“A duel, Hector? Egad, and have I so? With
whom, pray?</p>

<p>“Losh, man, you should ken that weel enough.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” quoth Sir John, pondering.</p>

<p>“I caught but a snatch of idle gossip concerning
you, John, and some English Viscount or other——”</p>

<p>“An Englishman, Hector, mark that! Ha,” mused
Sir John, “I have a vague recollection of throwing
somebody’s hat out of some window some time or other—but
whose hat, or what window, or when, I cannot
recall for the life o’ me. We must look into this,
Hector. Let us summon the Corporal and hear what
the perspicacious Robert hath to say.”</p>

<p>“What, Corporal Bob? He’s still with you, then,
John lad?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, Hector,” answered Sir John, ringing
the small silver bell at his elbow. “He is my major-domo,
my valet, my general factotum, and will never
be anything but a grenadier to the day of his death.
Here he is!” At this moment was a short, sharp
double knock and the door opened to admit a very
square-shouldered, sharp-eyed man extremely precise
as to clothes, speech and gesture, who, beholding Sir
Hector’s stalwart figure, halted suddenly, whipped up
right hand as if to touch neat wig but, thinking better
of it, bowed instead and immediately stood at attention.</p>

<p>“Stiff and straight as though on parade, Hector!”
murmured Sir John, whereupon the Corporal flushed
and immediately “stood easy.”</p>

<p>“Ha, Corporal Robert!” exclaimed Sir Hector.
“Dae ye mind the day we stormed the barricades afore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Maestricht, and me wi’ yon Frenchman’s baggonet
through me arrm? If ye hadna been there, I
shouldna be here—so, Corporal Bobbie, gi’e’s a grup
o’ y’r hand.” The Corporal’s cheek flushed again and
his eyes glowed as their fingers gripped, but when he
spoke it was to his master.</p>

<p>“You rang, Sir John?”</p>

<p>“I did, Robert. I desire you to inform us if I was
particularly drunk or no last night?”</p>

<p>“By no manner o’ means, Sir John.”</p>

<p>“You are ready to swear that?”</p>

<p>“Bible oath, Sir John!”</p>

<p>“I am not often drunk, I believe, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Never more than the occasion demands, sir—and
then very genteelly!”</p>

<p>“When was the last occasion, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Two days ago, sir, being the night of the Marquise
de Sauvray’s reception.”</p>

<p>“Was I—‘genteelly’ so, that night, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Maybe a leetle—elevated, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Sir John, “I’ve a dim memory of
breaking my cane over the link-boy’s head!”</p>

<p>“Link-boy was insolent, sir. Link-boy deserved
it.”</p>

<p>“I rejoice to know it, Robert. Was there aught
else remarkable in my home-coming on this occasion?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, sir! Though to be sure—you
sang——”</p>

<p>“Sang, did I?” sighed Sir John. “Anything else,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“No, sir! Except for gentleman’s perook stuffed
into your honour’s right-hand coat-pocket.”</p>

<p>“A peruke, Bob? Oh, begad! If we have it still,
show it to me!”</p>

<p>The imperturbable Robert vanished into Sir John’s
bedchamber and instantly returned with the article
in question, turning it upon his hand for his master’s
inspection.</p>

<p>“A brown Ramillie!” mused Sir John. “No, Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
I don’t seem to know it—it calls up no memory of
its erstwhile owner. What sword did I wear that
night?”</p>

<p>“Your favourite dress sword, sir, with the gold
hilt.”</p>

<p>“Fetch it, Bob.” The weapon was duly brought
and, unsheathing it, Sir John eyed it keenly from
pierced shell to glittering point. “Ha!” sighed he,
returning blade and scabbard. “What has not been,
will be, I fear! A gentleman’s hat out of a window
and a gentleman’s peruke in my pocket would seem
to indicate a meeting soon or late with some one or
other!”</p>

<p>“With Viscount Templemore, sir, as I am give to
understand.... Young gentleman has been taking
of fencing lessons constant ever since,” answered
Robert imperturbably.</p>

<p>“Templemore!” exclaimed Sir Hector. “Viscount
Templemore, is it? Man Jack, ye no can fecht wi’
him, he’s but a lad—a child—a bairn in breeks!”</p>

<p>“And but lately from England, eh, Bob?” questioned
Sir John.</p>

<p>“He has been here scarce a week, sir, I am give to
understand.”</p>

<p>“Mark that, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Man John, what d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“Robert, pray how many duels have I had forced
upon me since we came to Paris five years since?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-three, Sir John.”</p>

<p>“And most of ’em gentlemen newly arrived from
England—mark that also, Hector! Gentlemen, these,
who ha’ scarce made my acquaintance than they discover
an urgent desire to cross steel with me. Some
day I may have an accident and kill one of them,
which would grieve me, since he would die in evil
cause, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Man Jack, what cause are ye meaning?”</p>

<p>“The cause of my Lady Herminia Barrasdaile,
Hector, beyond doubt!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>Sir Hector made a turn up and down the room.</p>

<p>“But save us a’,” he exclaimed, halting suddenly,
“the wumman must be a pairfict deevil!”</p>

<p>“Nay, she’s merely a vengeful female, Hector.”</p>

<p>“But this puir Templemore laddie. I kenned his
father weel—man Jack, ye’ll no’ fecht the boy?”</p>

<p>“Pray, how may I avoid it, Hector? If he annoyed
me t’other night—as he must ha’ done, it seems that
I affronted him in turn most flagrantly—there is his
wig to prove it! How, then, can I possibly refuse
him satisfaction? You have fought ere now and
must appreciate the delicacy of my position.”</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” exclaimed Sir Hector, and took
another turn up and down the room.</p>

<p>“Do not distress yourself,” sighed Sir John; “if
we must fight I shall endeavour to disarm him
merely——”</p>

<p>“And may accidentally kill the lad, swordsman
though ye be, John ... remember Charles Tremayne!
So, man Jack, ye’ll juist no’ fight the laddie.”</p>

<p>“Not fight?” echoed Sir John.</p>

<p>“Having regaird tae his extreme youth and inexperience
and y’r ain reputation as a duellist and man
o’ bluid....”</p>

<p>“But, Hector, you must see that if I refuse on
account of his youth ’twill make him the laughing-stock
of all Paris.”</p>

<p>“Why then, Johnnie lad, ye maun juist rin
awa’——”</p>

<p>“Run away, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Juist that, John; ye maun gi’e Parus a chance
tae laugh at yersel’—howbeit you’ll rin awa’ fra’ the
puir lad as a man of honour should.”</p>

<p>“Impossible, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Man, there’s naething impossible tae the son o’
your father, I’m thinkin’!”</p>

<p>Sir John frowned and, crossing to the window,
beheld a carriage drawn up in front of the house.</p>

<p>“Robert,” said he, “we’ve visitors, I think; pray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
show them up here.” Robert departed forthwith
and presently reappeared to announce:</p>

<p>“My Lord Cheevely and Monsieur le Duc de Vaucelles.”
And into the room tripped two very fine
gentlemen enormously bewigged and beruffled, who,
having been duly presented to Sir Hector, flourished
laced hats and fluttered perfumed handkerchiefs,
bowing profoundly.</p>

<p>“Let me die, Sir John,” piped Lord Cheevely.
“’Od rabbit me, but ’tis pure joy to see ya’, I vow ’tis!
Pray forgive our dem’d sudden intrusion, but our
mission is delicate, sir, dooced, infinite delicate, and
admits o’ no delay, as my friend Vaucelles will tell
ya’!”</p>

<p>“Parfaitement!” quoth Monsieur le Duc, hat
a-flourish.</p>

<p>“Briefly and to the point, m’ dear Sir John,” continued
his lordship, “we come on behalf of our very
good friend, Viscount Templemore, who, with the
utmost passible humility i’ the world, begs the
honour of a meeting with ya’ at the earliest passible
moment.”</p>

<p>“Templemore?” repeated Sir John, tapping smooth
forehead with slender finger. “Templemore? I have
met him somewhere, I fancy. He is but lately come
to Paris, I think, my lord?”</p>

<p>“A week ago or thereabouts, m’ dear Sir John.”</p>

<p>“And he desires a meeting?”</p>

<p>“Most ardently, Sir John; the point in question
being, as ya’ remember, of a distinctly—personal
nature.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” nodded Sir John, “a brown Ramillie
wig.”</p>

<p>“Parfaitement!” answered Monsieur le Duc, with
a flourish.</p>

<p>“Precisely, Sir John!” answered Lord Cheevely.
“’Twill be small-swords, I presume?”</p>

<p>“No, my lord,” sighed Sir John.</p>

<p>“Ah, you decide for pistols, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“Nor pistols, my lord. I do not intend to fight
with Viscount Templemore.”</p>

<p>“Not—not fight?” gasped his lordship, while
Monsieur le Duc started and dropped his hat.</p>

<p>“No, my lord,” answered Sir John. “I am returning
Viscount Templemore’s wig with my sincerest
regrets so soon as ’tis combed and ironed——”</p>

<p>“D’ye mean, sir, that—that you actually refuse
Viscount Templemore’s challenge?”</p>

<p>“Actually and positively, my lord!”</p>

<p>“But—but,” stammered Lord Cheevely. “Oh,
demme, such action is impossible—was not—cannot
be!”</p>

<p>“That is why I do it, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rat me!” murmured his lordship, goggling.
“Oh, split me ... not fight! Dooce take and burn
me—this from you, Sir John! You that ha’ never
baulked ... had so many affairs ... gone out so
frequently—oh, smite me dumb!”</p>

<p>“My lord,” sighed Sir John, “I have been out so
very frequently that I am grown a little weary. You
will therefore pray tell Viscount Templemore that I
have given up duelling as a pastime for the present,
and purpose rusticating awhile——”</p>

<p>“If—if you are serious, sir,” exclaimed Lord
Cheevely, rolling his eyes, “demme, sir, if you are
serious, permit me to tell ya’ ya’ conduct is dem’d
strange, devilish queer and most dooced, dem’d
irregular!”</p>

<p>“Parfaitement!” added Monsieur le Duc.</p>

<p>Sir John smiled faintly, though his dreamy blue
eyes grew suddenly very keen and piercing.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he retorted, “I am about to leave
Paris for an indefinite period; when I return, should
you have any strictures to make upon my conduct,
I shall be charmed to notice ’em. Until then, sirs,
I have the honour to bid you adieu.”</p>

<p>And so Sir John bowed, the gentlemen bowed and
betook themselves away with never another word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“Man Jack,” exclaimed Sir Hector, as the door
closed, “leave Parus, is it? O John, laddie—d’ye
mean it?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I do, Hector. What with one thing and
another, I begin to find Paris a little wearing.”</p>

<p>“Is it hame at last, Johnnie—hame tae England?”</p>

<p>“Where else, Hector?”</p>

<p>“When dae we start, lad?”</p>

<p>“Sure, no time were better than the present. We
ride to-day, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Ou aye—yet bide a wee! Wha’ bee’s in y’r
bonnet, now, laddie?”</p>

<p>“I go to find my enemy, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Save us a’! D’ye mean the leddy?”</p>

<p>“Herminia!” nodded Sir John. “’Tis a pretty
name! Indeed, Hector, ’tis a sweet, pretty name—though
vastly difficult to find a rhyme for——”</p>

<p>“And what’ll ye be after wi’ the deevilish jade?”</p>

<p>“To exact a just and lasting vengeance, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Hoot awa’, Johnnie—hoot-toot, ye canna fecht
a wumman——”</p>

<p>“I can do worse, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Man John, wha’ dae ye mean?”</p>

<p>“I can marry her, Hector.”</p>

<span class="smaller">WHICH DESCRIBES A FORTUITOUS BUT FATEFUL MEETING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The Fates, those mysterious, unearthly sisters
who are for ever busied upon the destinies of
poor, finite humanity—the Fates, it seems, decreed
that my Lady Herminia Barrasdaile, travelling full
speed for Paris, should be suddenly precipitated upon
the soft, resilient form of her devoted maid, Mrs.
Betty, to that buxom creature’s gasping dismay and
her own vast indignation; wherefore, the huge vehicle
coming to an abrupt standstill, down fell the window
and out went my lady’s angry, albeit lovely, countenance
to demand instant explanation from coachmen,
footmen and the world in general.</p>

<p>“Why, ye see, my lady,” answered red-faced Giles,
the coachman, his Sussex calm entirely unruffled,
“it do so ’appen as our off-side rear spring’s gone,
mam.”</p>

<p>“Gone, man, gone? Who’s stolen it? What a
plague d’you mean, Giles?” demanded her ladyship.</p>

<p>“I means broke, my lady, snapped, mam, parted-loike.
We’m down on our back-axle—an’ theer y’are,
mam!”</p>

<p>“Why then, mend it, Giles; mend it at once and
let us get on—I must reach Paris to-night if possible.”</p>

<p>“Aye, we’ll mend it, my lady, sure to goodness—in
toime——”</p>

<p>“How long?”</p>

<p>“Why, it du all depend, my lady—maybe an hour,
maybe tu——”</p>

<p>Wide swung the heavy coach-door and forth sprang<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
her ladyship, a slim and graceful fury who, perceiving
the damage and necessary delay, swore as only a very
fine lady might, with a tripping comprehensiveness and
passionate directness that reduced Giles and the two
footmen to awed silence.</p>

<p>“Hush, mam!” pleaded Mrs. Betty, as her lady
paused for breath. “Don’t ’ee now, there’s a duck——”</p>

<p>“But, zounds, wench,” cried her mistress, “you
know ’tis a case o’ life and death ... to be delayed
thus....”</p>

<p>“Aye, I know, mem—but do ’ee take a sniff at your
vinaigrette, my lady——”</p>

<p>“Tush!” exclaimed her ladyship. “Hold your
silly tongue, do!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady ... but there’s a light yonder
among the trees—an inn, I think, mam——”</p>

<p>“Ha—an inn? Thomas, go, see—and bring help
instantly—and order another coach if there be one!
Run, oaf, run!” Away sped Thomas, a long-barrelled
pistol protruding from either side-pocket, while my
lady paced to and fro, fuming with impatience, until
back he scurried with two chattering French ostlers
at his heels, to say it was an inn, sure enough, but that
no manner of conveyance was to be had.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that!” exclaimed my lady.
“Come, Betty!” And off she hasted forthwith, the
meek and obedient Betty attendant. It was a small,
drowsy inn, but at my lady’s advent it awoke to
sudden life and bustle, its every chamber seemed full
of stir, tripping feet and chattering voices; and all
for the English Miladi’s comfort and welfare.</p>

<p>Insomuch that, embarrassed by attentions so pervading
and multifarious, my Lady Barrasdaile caught
up Betty’s cloak of homespun, a hooded garment for
country wear, and, muffled in its ample folds, went
a-walking.</p>

<p>The road, bordered by shady trees, led up a hill,
and, lured by the sunset glory, and joying, moreover,
to stretch her limbs, cramped by the long journey,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
my lady ascended the hill and, reaching the top, had
paused to admire the view, when she became aware
of two horsemen approaching from the opposite
direction, and instantly apprehending them to be
highwaymen, she slipped aside into an adjacent
thicket, waiting for them to pass.</p>

<p>Now as she stood thus, seeing but unseen, the
mysterious Fates decreed that Sir John Dering,
reaching the hilltop in turn, should rein in his horse
within a yard of her, to glance round about him upon
the peaceful countryside, little dreaming of the bright
eyes that watched him so keenly, or the ears that
hearkened so inquisitively.</p>

<p>“A sweet prospect, Hector!” he exclaimed; “fair
and chaste and yet a little sad. ’Tis like looking
deep into the eyes of a good woman—if there be such!
It fills the soul with a sense of unworthiness and
sorrow for the folly o’ the wasted years.”</p>

<p>“Aye, John! An’ fower pistols in oor holsters
an’ twa in my pockets gi’e us six shot in case o’
eeventualities.”</p>

<p>“The wasted years!” murmured Sir John, musing
gaze upon the distant horizon. “’Tis a night to
grieve in, Hector, to yearn for better things.”</p>

<p>“Aye! And though six shot is fair I’m wishin’ ye
carried a rale sword like my Andrew here,’stead o’
yon bodkin!”</p>

<p>“How then,” smiled Sir John, rousing; “are you
expecting battle, murder and sudden death, Hector?”</p>

<p>“A dinna say no or aye t’ that, Johnnie man, forbye
these French roads be aye ill-travellin’, an’ I was ever
a cautious body, y’ ken. ’Tis peety ye left Corporal
Rob behind; he’s a fair hand wi’ pistol or whinger,
I mind. However, let us push on ere it be dark.”</p>

<p>“Nay, there’s the moon rising yonder, Hector.”</p>

<p>“The moon—and what o’t, John? I’m for having
my legs under a table and something savoury on’t,
lad.”</p>

<p>“Then do you ride forward, Hector, and order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
supper—there is an inn down yonder, I remember;
I’ll wait for the moon to rise——”</p>

<p>“Mune-rise? I’fegs, lad, she’ll do’t very weel wi’
oot ye, I’m thinkin’!”</p>

<p>“Aye, but I’m minded to dream awhile, Hector;
the moon ever stirs my imagination——”</p>

<p>“Hoot-toot! De’il awa’ wi’ y’r dreamin’ an’
imaginationin’! ’Tis mysel’ wad tak’ ye for a puir,
moonstruck daftie if I didna ken ye for John Dering
and son o’ your father!”</p>

<p>“If,” sighed Sir John, “if, Hector, you could suggest
an apt rhyme for ‘soul,’ now, I should take it kindly
... though, to be sure, ‘dole’ might do at a pinch.”</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” snorted General Sir Hector
MacLean, and urged his horse on down the hill.</p>

<p>Being alone, Sir John dismounted, and tethering
his animal, seated himself on grassy bank and gave
himself up to introspective reverie.</p>

<p>The awesome, brooding stillness, the splendour of
the rising moon, the mystery of the surrounding landscape,
and all the magic of this early midsummer night
wrought in him a pensive melancholy, a growing discontent
of himself and the latter years, and he luxuriated in
a consciousness of his infinite unworthiness.</p>

<p>Thus, with wistful gaze upon the full-orbed moon,
Sir John had already mentally forsworn the world,
the flesh and the devil, when he was roused suddenly
by a rustling of leaves near by and the sharp crack
of a dried twig; next moment he was beside his
horse and had whipped forth, cocked and levelled one
of his travelling pistols.</p>

<p>“Qui va la?” he demanded, and then in English:
“Come out! Show yourself, or I fire!”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” cried a voice. “Don’t!” The leaves
parted suddenly, and Sir John beheld a woman within
a yard of him; majestically tall she was, and muffled
in the long folds of a coarse cloak, beneath whose
shadowy hood he glimpsed the pale oval of a face and
a single strand of curling hair darkly innocent of powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>Sir John lowered the pistol and, removing his hat,
bowed.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Phyllida!” said he.</p>

<p>“That ain’t my name,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Then it should be, for ’tis a charming name and
suits you.”</p>

<p>“You—you’m English, sir?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“I thank God!” he answered gravely.</p>

<p>“Then—oh, I am safe!” she sighed, and sinking
upon the grassy bank, hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>“Safe?” he repeated, touching her bowed head
very gently. “Never doubt it, child—all heaven be
my witness. ’Tis easy to guess you English also, and
of the sweet south country, I think?”</p>

<p>At this she raised her head and he saw a handsome
face framed in dark, rebellious curls, eyes wide and
innocent, and a vivid, full-lipped mouth.</p>

<p>“O sir, ye du be a mortal clever guesser—I were
born in Sussex!” she answered.</p>

<p>“Sussex?” murmured Sir John. “Seely Sussex!
I was born there too, ’twixt the sheltering arms of
Firle and Windover.... The gentle South Downs
... I loved every velvet slope of them! I mind the
sweet, warm scent of the wild thyme, and the dance
of the scabious flowers in the wind ... ’tis years
since I saw them last.”</p>

<p>“But the wild thyme is still sweet i’ the sun, sir,
an’ the scabious flowers do be a-noddin’ an’ beckonin’
as we sit here.”</p>

<p>“Beckoning, child? ’Tis a sweet thought!
Beckoning me back to England ... to the reverent
stillness of the immemorial hills ... my loved Downs!
Beckoning me back to the old house that has stood
empty so long! Paris behind me, London before
me ... but deep in my heart a memory of the silent
Downs ... and of a better living.”</p>

<p>“’Ee du talk tur’ble strange, sir!” she exclaimed,
her wide gaze searching his wistful features.</p>

<p>“’Tis the moon, child—blame the moon! Though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
her Lunatic Majesty doth usually afflict me with a
poetic fervour that erupts in somewhat indifferent
verse. But what o’ yourself, child? Whence are
you—what do you so far from home?”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir,” she retorted, shaking her head, “you’m
so clever you must guess if ye can.”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” smiled Sir John. “Suffer me to sit
beside you—thus, and whiles we gaze up at stately
Luna, Chaste Dian, Isis the mysterious, I, her most
humble votary, will strive to rede thee thy past,
present and future. And first—thy name? It should
be sweet and simple like thyself and breathe of
England. And if it is not Phyllida, it should be
Rosamond or Lettice or Anthea or——”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir,” she sighed, “’tis only Rose!”</p>

<p>“Aye, and what better!” quoth he. “’Tis a sweet
English name and easy to rhyme with. Let us try.”
And with his gaze uplift to the moon, Sir John extemporised
thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O flower of Love, thou fragrant Rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy love methinks should be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A balm to soothe all earthly woes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sweetness that unfading blows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through all eternity——</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Hum! ’Tis not so bad, though ’faith it might be
better. That last line is something trite perhaps!
Aye, I may better it with a little thought!”</p>

<p>“Nay—nay,’tis well as ’tis!” she exclaimed.
“’Tis excellent, I ... ’deed, sir, I do think you’m
a tur’ble clever gentleman!”</p>

<p>“Though no poet, Rose, I fear! So much for thy
name! Now as to thyself. Thou’rt a woman and
young, and hast therefore dreamed o’ love——”</p>

<p>“La, sir, how should’ee know that? ’Ee du make
me blush!”</p>

<p>“And have you loved often, child?”</p>

<p>“Oh, fie and no, sir! I’m no fine lady——”</p>

<p>“Heaven be praised!” exclaimed Sir John fervently,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
and lowered his gaze to the face so near his own, which
was immediately averted.</p>

<p>“Pray won’t your honour please tell me some more
about myself?” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“As what, child?”</p>

<p>“What I am, what I do for a livin’—an’ all about
me?”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” pursued Sir John, “you are maid to
serve some prideful, painted creature——”</p>

<p>“Oh,’tis wonderful!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Some haughty, ineffective she who perchance rails
at thee, pinches and slaps thee, pulls thy pretty hair,
envying thy sweet, fresh beauty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ’tis like witchcraft!” she murmured in awestruck
tones.</p>

<p>“And thou’rt in France, child, because she is here
and travels belike to Paris.” Sir John turned to find
her regarding him in speechless wonder.</p>

<p>“Well, child?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“O sir!” she whispered. “’Tis all—so—marvellous
true. Now tell me, oh, please your honour—tell me o’
the future. Shall I ever be a fine, grand lady—shall
I?”</p>

<p>“God forbid!” he answered. “Nature formed
thee a better thing! Thou’rt artless as the flowers
that bloom, and the birds that sing because they must,
for pure joy of it. Thou’rt sweet and fresh as the
breath of Spring—heaven keep thee so, if ’tis indeed
to Paris you journey, child.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, and so ’tis.”</p>

<p>“Ha—Paris!” quoth he and scowled. “Alas,
child, you shall find there no fragrance of wild thyme,
no dancing scabious flowers.... And your mistress
drags you to Paris, because she is a fine lady, an
exotic, blooming best in an atmosphere that for thee
... ah, child ... alas, sweet Rose! Heaven send
a clean wind to cherish thee lest thy sweetness languish
... fade and wither.... Ha, the devil! Why
must she drag you to Paris?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>“O, your worship, ’tis on a matter o’ life an’
death. We should be a-galloping at this moment but
that the coach broke down, and my lady in a mighty
pet—such tantrums! So after I’d put her to bed—and
such a bed! I crept out o’ the inn—and such an
inn! And lost my way ... and a man ... ran
after me and so I ... I found you, sir. An’ now I
must be a-goin’ back an’t please you, sir, for I must be
on my road to Paris, along o’ my lady an’ all to stop
two gentlemen fightin’ each other!”</p>

<p>“Ha, a duel, child? Do you chance to know these
gentlemen’s names?”</p>

<p>“For sure, sir, my lady talks o’ naught beside!
One’s Viscount Templemore, an’ t’other’s Sir John
Dering—‘the Wicked Dering,’ as they call him at
home.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Sir John, staring up at the moon
again. “Ha!” And in a little, turning to regard
his companion, he found her watching him bright-eyed
from the shadow of her hood. “So they call
him ‘the Wicked Dering’ at home, do they, Rose?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir, ever an’ always.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well!” sighed Sir John. “Howbeit, child,
you can assure your lady that her journey to Paris
is wholly unnecessary.”</p>

<p>“How, sir.... Oh, d’ye mean she is ... too
late? Have they fought already?”</p>

<p>“I mean they cannot fight, because Sir John Dering
hath run away.”</p>

<p>“Run away ... Sir John Dering? Without
fighting?” she questioned breathlessly. “Oh, ’tis
impossible!”</p>

<p>“’Tis very truth—upon my honour.”</p>

<p>“You ... you are sure, sir?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely, child! I happen to know Sir John
Dering and something of his concerns.”</p>

<p>“Oh ... you are ... his friend, sir?”</p>

<p>“Nay, hardly that, Rose,” sighed Sir John; “indeed,
some might call me his most inveterate enemy....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
But for Sir John Dering I might have been a ...
happier man.”</p>

<p>“And so ... you hate him?”</p>

<p>“Let us rather say—I grieve for him.”</p>

<p>“But they say he is very wicked—a devil!”</p>

<p>“Nay, child, he is merely a very human man and
something melancholy.” After this they sat side by
side in silence for a while, Sir John gazing up at the
moon and she at him.</p>

<p>“However,” said he suddenly, “your lady need no
longer drag you to Paris, seeing her journey is unnecessary.
So soon as we reach the inn, I myself
will make this sufficiently manifest to her.”</p>

<p>“You—you will see my lady, sir?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I will, child.”</p>

<p>“Then an’t please your honour—’tis time I found
the inn.”</p>

<p>“Found it, child?”</p>

<p>“Alack, yes, sir, for I’ve lost it! But if your honour
will only help me find it ... your honour is so
marvellous clever!”</p>

<p>“Nay, Rose, our wiser course were to sit here and
let it find us—or rather, my friend will come a-searching
me so soon as supper be ready and ... indeed,
yonder he comes, I fear! Yes,” sighed Sir John, as
the huge form of Sir Hector loomed nearer, “I grieve
to say he is here already!”</p>

<p>Perceiving Sir John’s companion, MacLean halted
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Losh, man Jack!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“’Tis I, Hector. Have you ordered supper?”</p>

<p>“I hae that!”</p>

<p>“Then pray mount my horse and lead the way.
Rose and I follow.”</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” quoth Sir Hector, and, mounting
forthwith, he trotted down the hill, but profound reprobation
was in the cock of his weatherbeaten hat and
the set of his broad shoulders as he went.</p>

<span class="smaller">TELLETH OF MRS. ROSE, THE GUILEFUL INNOCENT</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“Strip, wench, strip!” cried Lady Herminia
Barrasdaile, tossing the disguising cloak into
a corner of the bedchamber. “Off with your clothes,
girl, off with ’em—we’re both of a size, thank heavens—so
strip, Betty, strip, as I’m a-doing!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” sighed comely Betty, large and
patient and calmly indulgent to the unexpected whims
and caprices of her imperious mistress. “But pray,
mam, why should us undress afore bedtime?”</p>

<p>“That we may dress again, sure, Bet; to-night I
am you and you are me ... except that my name
is ‘Rose—Rose,’ you’ll remember!” admonished her
ladyship, kicking off her fine gown.</p>

<p>“Yes, mam,” answered placid Mrs. Betty; “but
why for ‘Rose’?”</p>

<p>“Because ’twas the first name occurred to me.
Come, tie me these strings, wench! Sir John Dering
is below, and if he should demand to see me—I mean
you——”</p>

<p>“Sir John, my lady? Dering? O lud, not—not
<i>the</i> Sir John Dering—not <i>him</i>, my lady?”</p>

<p>“Himself at last, face to face, Bet. Help me into
this gown o’ yours.... O gad, what an infinity of
buttons! Fasten me in, child! See, you are bigger
in the waist than I, Bet ... and devilish tight above
here ... I vow I can scarce breathe! Nay, button
away, girl, I’ll endure it.... I must breathe prettily,
pantingly. My Lady Felicity Flyte hath the trick
on’t and ’tis much admired, so I’ll e’en pant and
endure! Now, one o’ your mobs, girl, a cap with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
ribbands to’t ... aye, this shall serve—so! Now,
how am I?”</p>

<p>“Ravishing, my lady! O mam!”</p>

<p>“Why, your things become me, I think.”</p>

<p>“Vastly, mem! O my lady!”</p>

<p>“Now,’tis thy turn, Bet. Shalt wear my yellow
lute-string wi’ the panniers.”</p>

<p>“O my lady, but you ha’ wore it but once!”</p>

<p>“No matter,’tis thine, Betty. Come, out with it
and on with it. Nay, first your hair must be powdered
and pomatumed, your cheeks smeared wi’ rouge—yourself
sufficiently pulvilled——”</p>

<p>“But, O mam, why must I——”</p>

<p>“In case Sir John desires speech with you—that is
to say, with me. He may not and yet again he may,
and you must be prepared.”</p>

<p>“O mem,” quavered Betty. “O my lady—suppose
he stare at me?”</p>

<p>“Stare back at him, for sure—like any other lady
o’ fashion!”</p>

<p>“But what must I say?”</p>

<p>“As little as possible! So long as you look sufficiently
handsome and stare bold enough, ’twill serve. Now,
let me look at you! Cock your chin, girl—so! Gad’s
life, but you’re a handsome creature and look as
haughty a fine city-madam as need be. Now mind
to be sufficiently disdainful of all and sundry and
especially of me——”</p>

<p>“Nay, my lady, ’twere impossible! I shall be
calling you mam and madam, for sure.”</p>

<p>“Zounds no, Bet, ’twould ruin all! You must be
mighty short with me, rap my knuckles with your fan
and rail on me if possible——”</p>

<p>“Rail on thee, my dear lady—oh, I couldn’t!”</p>

<p>“You must, girl! And if you could swear a little
’twould be pure!”</p>

<p>“Swear, mem—me? Who at?”</p>

<p>“At Sir John Dering if possible.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know how to swear, mem.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve heard me often enough!”</p>

<p>“Aye, but I could never swear so sweet and ladylike
as you, mem.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” sighed her ladyship, “we must
forgo your swearing, I suppose, though ’tis pity. But
hark’ee, Bet, and mark this well! Should Sir John
come endeavouring to persuade you to return to England,
you will raise your eyebrows—so! Droop your
eyelids—thus! and say: ‘Howbeit, sir, ’tis my pleasure
to journey on to Paris!’ Then turn your back on
him and send me to command your coach to the
door——”</p>

<p>“Aye—and when it comes, my lady?”</p>

<p>“Why, get in and drive away, sure!”</p>

<p>“But where to, mem?”</p>

<p>“Towards Paris, silly wench—or anywhere you
choose——”</p>

<p>“And you, madam? You will come along o’
me?”</p>

<p>“Perchance I may and perchance not. Mayhap
I shall run away—disappear at the last moment—I’m
not decided on this yet——”</p>

<p>“O my dear lady——”</p>

<p>“If I should think fit to run away, you will drive
as far as St. Pol, then turn back to Dieppe, where you
shall probably find me at the ‘Eperon d’Or’—Giles
knows it——”</p>

<p>“But, my lady—O mem—what o’ yourself?”</p>

<p>“So long as I am myself I shall be safe, child. I’ll
play my part, do you play yours! Remember, should
you meet the gentlemen below, swim in your walk,
tilt your chin, say nothing—and stare. Stare above
’em, below ’em and through ’em, but never at ’em.
And now I’ll go order supper—in private, for thy sake,
Bet. Lud, but I’m famished!” And a-down the
creaking stair tripped my Lady Herminia Barrasdaile,
as dainty a waiting-maid as ever was or ever will be.</p>

<p>Then it chanced that Sir John, rolling his eyes in
the throes of poetical composition, suddenly beheld<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
her standing radiant in the doorway, all fresh, shapely
young womanhood from ribbanded cap to trim shoe;
and struck by her air of modesty and all the shy-sweet
beauty of her, he sighed, closed his tablets and slipped
them into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Ah, Rose,” said he, “thou flower of innocence,
sure no words of mine may do thee justice; thou’rt
beyond my poor poesy. Come hither, child, and
tell me, is your mistress still for Paris?”</p>

<p>“’Deed, yes, sir, she seems mighty set on’t.”</p>

<p>“Alas, sweet Rose!”</p>

<p>“Is Paris so tur’ble wicked, sir?”</p>

<p>“’Tis no place for the like o’ thee—thou gentle
innocent!” At this, my Lady Herminia glanced at
him shy-eyed, drooped her lashes, pleated a fold in
her neat apron and contrived to become the very
perfect embodiment of all that ever had been, was or
possibly could be virginally shy and sweet and innocent.</p>

<p>“But I do hear ’tis a mighty fine place, sir,” said
she softly, “and I do yearn to see the ladies and grand
gentlemen. And, if ’tis so wicked, naught harmful
can come anigh me by reason I do ever wear this—night
and day, your honour!” And she drew from her
bosom a small, plain gold cross suspended about her
shapely throat by a ribband. “’Twas my mother’s,
sir, and ’tis good against all evil ... and I shall say
my prayers!”</p>

<p>Now at this, Sir John must needs call to mind
certain unworthy episodes of the last five years: his
keen gaze wavered and he sat, chin on breast, staring
into the smouldering fire.</p>

<p>“And so d’ye see, sir,” she continued, finding him
silent, “I shall not fear anything, nor any one—no,
not even though he be wicked as—as the ‘wicked Sir
John Dering’ himself!”</p>

<p>“Child,” said Sir John at last, “go ask your lady
to favour me with five minutes’ conversation.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour!” she answered, curtsying, and
departed obediently forthwith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Thus Sir John was presently ushered upstairs and
into the presence of a tall, handsome creature,
magnificently attired, who acknowledged his profound
obeisance with a curt nod, and thereafter stared at
him from head to foot and sniffed.</p>

<p>“Madam,” quoth he, a little startled, “I come
to reassure you as to the welfare of Viscount
Templemore.”</p>

<p>The lady stared haughtily at his dusty boots. “I
am happy to tell you,” continued Sir John, “that
the meeting will not take place——” The lady,
tilting dimpled chin, stared fixedly at the topmost
curls of Sir John’s peruke. “If, therefore,” he proceeded,
“you contemplate returning immediately to
England, my friend and I shall be honoured to escort
you.”</p>

<p>The lady shook her handsome head, shrugged her
dimpled shoulders and sniffed louder than ever, so
much so that Sir John retreated somewhat precipitately.</p>

<p>“Tush, sir, fie and no!” she exclaimed. “I’m
minded to go to Paris an’ to Paris I’ll go!”</p>

<p>Sir John opened his eyes a little wider than usual
and bowed himself out forthwith.</p>

<p>“O my lady,” cried Betty so soon as the door had
closed, “O mem, did I do it right?”</p>

<p>“’Twas admirable, Bet! Didst see him blench and
flush? You dear, clever creature! There is that
taffety gown—’tis thine, child—aye, and the neck-chain
with the pearl pendant! He flushed—he
blenched! Come kiss me, Betty!”</p>

<span class="smaller">SHEWETH THE WICKED DERING IN A NEW RÔLE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Sir John, deep-plunged in gloomy abstraction,
was suddenly aroused by the noisy entrance of
two travellers, very elegant gentlemen who, cramped
from their chaise, stamped and yawned and stretched,
and damned the dust, the road, the inn, the landlord
and all creation save themselves. Loudest of the
twain was a tall, youngish man who wore a stupendous
periwig, a gentleman very small as to eyes and large
as to teeth that gleamed between the lips of a heavy
mouth.</p>

<p>To them presently came the landlord, who, with
many profound obeisances and servile excuses, begged
them to follow him to a chamber more suited to their
nobilities.</p>

<p>Left alone, Sir John sat legs outstretched, chin on
breast, staring at the toes of his dusty riding-boots,
lost once more in gloomy retrospection of the last five
years, his dejection ever deepening, until he was
aroused for the second time, as from the other side
of the partition behind his chair rose a man’s chuckling
laugh, the sound of desperate struggling, a woman’s
scream.</p>

<p>Sir John arose and, stepping out into the passage,
threw open the door of an adjoining chamber and saw
this: Upon a roomy settle the gentleman in the large
toupet and upon his knees, struggling wildly in the
merciless clasp of his arms, the girl Rose. Sir John’s
serenity vanished, his habitual languor changed to
vehement action: ensued the quick, light stamp of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
a foot, a glitter of darting steel and the gentleman’s
lofty periwig, transfixed upon Sir John’s unerring
sword-point, was whisked into a distant corner. Then
Sir John spoke:</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said he softly, “favour me by releasing
your so charming captive.” Next moment she was
free, and, shrinking to the wall, saw Sir John’s face
quite transfigured, the mobile lips grimly set, the
delicate nostrils a-quiver, eyes fierce and threatening
as his sword. “Sir,” he continued in the same gentle
tone, “permit me to tell you that I do not like your
face—it irritates me! Pray have the kindness to
remove it, therefore—take it hence or——”</p>

<p>“What the devil!” exclaimed the wigless gentleman,
getting upon his legs.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said Sir John, “child, pray leave us!”
For a moment she hesitated then, uttering an inarticulate
cry, fled from the room, and Sir John closed
the door. “Now, sir,” quoth he, saluting the gentleman
with an airy flourish of his weapon, “if your
friend yonder will be so obliging as to help push this
table into the corner we can settle our little affair
quite comfortably, I think.”</p>

<p>“Damnation!” exclaimed the wigless gallant, and,
clapping hand to sword, half drew it, then checked
and stood at gaze. When next he spoke his tone was
altogether different: “You ... I think I have the
honour to address Sir John Dering?”</p>

<p>“The same, sir.”</p>

<p>The gentleman sheathed his sword and bowed.</p>

<p>“My name is Scarsdale, sir,” said he. “I had the
pleasure of meeting you in Paris lately—at the
Marquise de Sauvray’s rout, if you remember?”</p>

<p>“I do not, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Scarsdale took out his snuff-box, stared at it,
tapped it, fumbled with it and bowed.</p>

<p>“My dear Sir John,” said he, “if I had the curst
misfortune to ... ah ... to cross you in the matter
of ... an ... Yon rustic Venus ... poach on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
your preserves, ’twas done all unwitting and I apologise....
A delicious creature; I felicitate you.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Scarsdale,” answered Sir John, “I accept
your explanation. At the same time, I take leave to
point you to the fact that this inn is small and I detest
being crowded. May I then venture to suggest that you
and your friend seek accommodation—elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“How, sir—how, Sir John?” stammered Mr.
Scarsdale, running nervous hand over wigless, close-cropped
head. “You ... you ask us to—to——”</p>

<p>“Favour me with your absence, sir.”</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. Scarsdale stood mute; his face
grew suddenly red and as swiftly pale, his eyes glared,
his large teeth gleamed evilly, but noting Sir John’s
resolute air, his piercing gaze, the serene assurance of
his pose, Mr. Scarsdale commanded himself sufficiently
to bow with a flourish.</p>

<p>“Tom,” quoth he to his silent companion, “ha’ the
goodness to pick up my wig.” Receiving which indispensable
article, he clapped it on somewhat at random
and, hurrying from the room with the silent Tom at
his heels, was presently heard calling for horses and
chaise and damning all and sundry louder than ever
until, with a stamp of hoofs and rattle of wheels, he
was borne damning on his way.</p>

<p>Sir John was in the act of sheathing his sword,
when he turned at sound of a light footstep.</p>

<p>“Ah, Rose,” sighed he, gazing into her troubled
eyes, “yonder go two of your ‘grand gentlemen’—Paris
teems with such! Better surely an honest
English lover in homespun than be hunted by Brutality
in lace and velvet. Did they fright thee, child ...
and despite thy prayers and little cross?” Here she
hid her face in her hands. “Nay, Rose, if they
reverence not thy virgin purity how should they
revere aught else! And Paris reeks of such as they
... to hunt thy fresh young beauty! And thou
... in thy pretty innocence—alas! Wilt thou to
Paris, child?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“Your honour knows my lady is determined on’t”</p>

<p>“Then be you determined also. You have a chin—let
me look at it.”</p>

<p>Unwillingly she raised her head, eyes abased yet
very conscious of his scrutiny.</p>

<p>“Pray what o’ my chin, sir?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“Firmly round and with a dimple in’t!” he answered.
“’Tis a chin speaks thee resolute to choose and act
for thyself. So—if your lady will to Paris let her go
without you, child.”</p>

<p>“Without me?” she repeated, innocent eyes upraised
to his. “O sir, do you mean me to bide here—with
your honour?”</p>

<p>At this direct question Sir John was silent a moment,
and, meeting the intensity of her gaze, felt his cheeks
burn unwontedly.</p>

<p>“Could you trust yourself to—my honour, child?”</p>

<p>For a long moment she made no reply, and Sir
John marvelled to find himself awaiting her answer
with a feeling akin to anxiety. “Well, child?” he
demanded at length.</p>

<p>“I ... think so, sir.”</p>

<p>“You are not sure, then?”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir,” she sighed, “I be only a poor maid and
you’m a grand gentleman like—like them as you
druv’ away.”</p>

<p>“Ha, d’ye think so, girl!” he exclaimed pettishly.
“Confound me, but you are not flattering! Can you
indeed think me of such base, material clay, Rose?
Are you so addle-witted, so dense, so dull to suppose
’tis your pink-and-white prettiness lures me?”</p>

<p>“La, no, your honour—indeed, no!” she answered
humbly, her voice a little uncertain and her face
hid beneath the laces of her mob-cap. “Though—though
your honour do think I be—pretty?” she
added questioningly.</p>

<p>“Pretty?” he repeated scornfully. “Tush, child!
What hath your prettiness to do with it? ’Tis your
natural goodness draweth me, your fresh simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
your purity and unstained innocence! I needs must
reverence the white soul of you——”</p>

<p>Here, Sir John chancing to look down and she to
look up, their glances met and he was abruptly silent;
wherefore she curtsied demurely an murmured:</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour!” But Sir John was silent so
long that she began to tap with fidgeting foot and to
pleat a fold in her apron.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said he at last, “look at me!” Her eyes
were raised in instant obedience, eyes deep and dark
and heavy-lashed, that met his keen scrutiny unwavering
and wholly unabashed.</p>

<p>“You laughed, I think?” he challenged.</p>

<p>“Who—me, sir?” she cried, eyes wider than ever.</p>

<p>“Do any women possess souls, I wonder!” said he
bitterly.</p>

<p>“Parson do think so, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Then perchance you may find yours some day,
for, until you do, child, you must remain and
never know or appreciate the great, good things of
life——”</p>

<p>“Tripe an’ pig’s-trotters, John!” exclaimed Sir
Hector, bursting in upon them, brandishing a long-handled
fork. “Par-boiled, ye ken, an’ crisped in a
brisk oven——”</p>

<p>A rush of flying feet; the bang of closing door;
a sound of stifled, hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>“Losh, man Jack,” exclaimed Sir Hector, staring
into his companion’s scowling visage, “was yon that
Rose creature?”</p>

<p>“Yon was!” answered Sir John grimly. “And what
then, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” snorted General Sir Hector
Lauchlan MacLean.</p>

<p>“Pray, Hector, what might you mean?”</p>

<p>“Supper, John! Tripe an’ pig’s-trotters—aye,
an’ cooked by my ain hand, whateffer—the smell o’
yon wad mak’ Lucullus watter i’ the mou’! Sae dinna
froon, lad, but come an’ eat!”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ALLURE OF SIMPLICITY: MOONLIGHT AND AN ELOPEMENT</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“Betty lass,” exclaimed my Lady Herminia,
surveying her handsome features in the
travelling-mirror, “Old Drury hath lost a notable and
vastly clever actress in me! I ha’ played the innocent
country wench to such infinite perfection of admiration
that the poor fool languishes already ... ogles my
charms and talks—of my soul! Oh, a dangerous
man, Bet, a wicked wretch—one o’ your soft-spoke,
smooth-tongued, dove-eyed, silky, seducing monsters—a
very serpent of iniquity, child! But I’m no
poor, meek, bread-and-butter miss to be lured to shame
or whispered to destruction by any such perfidious
and patent villain, not I, Bet!”</p>

<p>“Oh no, my lady!” nodded placid Betty. “No,
indeed, mam, heaven knows you’m a sight too clever
an’ knowin’——”</p>

<p>“Knowing, woman! Ha, what d’ye mean by
‘knowing,’ pray?”</p>

<p>“La, I don’t know, my lady ... I only know as
you know yourself a match for any fine gentleman,
villain or no, ever and always, mam——”</p>

<p>“’S bud, but I should hope so, Bet, especially this
poor creature!”</p>

<p>“Aye, to be sure, but ... O my lady, if he be
truly dangerous——”</p>

<p>“Tush! I know the breed, and forewarned is forearmed.
And he mistaketh me for a country simpleton
dazzled by his fine airs! So I intend to make it my
duty to teach him a shrewd lesson, Betty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, mem, but how?”</p>

<p>“I intend to lower his pride, girl—to shame him
cruelly.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, ’tis as good as done, mam. But——”</p>

<p>“I’ll drag his insufferable self-esteem in the dust
... through the mud ... trample it ’neath my
feet ... make him a mock—a jest and byword.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you will, my lady, but how?”</p>

<p>“How, Bet? Why, by running away with him to
begin with, for sure.”</p>

<p>“O mem!” ejaculated Betty, lifting imploring
hands. “O my dear lady——”</p>

<p>“Woman, don’t wail—’tis useless! I regard this
as a sacred duty, girl!”</p>

<p>“But ... O lud, my lady ... think o’ your
ladyship’s good name ... the scandal——”</p>

<p>“One must be prepared to suffer in the high cause
of duty, Betty child ... and, besides, my name will
be Rose Ashton!”</p>

<p>“But, O my lady, if you run away—what o’ me?”</p>

<p>“You will proceed towards Paris in the coach as
I ha’ told you, child! You will be quite safe with
Giles and the footmen. And this minds me, the
coach should be ready, and the sooner you start the
better. Go down and bid Giles prepare for the road
immediately. Stay, you cannot in all that finery!
We’ll send Rose instead!” And away sped my
lady accordingly, quite deaf to Betty’s reproachful
wailings.</p>

<p>Thus Sir John, toying gloomily with knife and
fork, was presently aware of stir and bustle within
the house and of stamping hoofs and rumbling wheels
without: wherefore he arose and crossed to the
window in time to see Rose’s mistress, muffled to the
eyes, clamber into the great four-horsed travelling-chariot,
followed by Rose herself similarly attired;
he watched the footmen close the door, put up the
steps and swing themselves into the rumble, heard
the hoarse command of the driver, a sudden clatter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
of straining hoofs, and away rolled the cumbrous
vehicle towards Paris.</p>

<p>“And despite her chin!” sighed Sir John within
himself. “Poor, silly, innocent child! Ah well,
perchance her prayers and little cross may avail.
Heaven send it so——”</p>

<p>Here he was roused by a huge hand on his shoulder
and Sir Hector’s voice in his ear:</p>

<p>“Och-heigh! Are ye wearyin’ for Parus—sae sune,
John?”</p>

<p>“Paris? Ha—’tis a sink of iniquity!” he retorted
so fiercely that Sir Hector peered.</p>

<p>“Oo aye,” he nodded. “’Tis a’ that, laddie, and
yet ye contrived tae pit up wi’t for five lang year.”
At this Sir John frowned and was silent. “Aweel,
aweel,” quoth Sir Hector, “there’s England waitin’
ye, aye, and happiness, I trust——”</p>

<p>“Happiness!” repeated Sir John scornfully.</p>

<p>“Why not, lad? ’Tis time ye married and settled
doon——”</p>

<p>“Horrific thought!” growled Sir John.</p>

<p>“Why, then, John,” quoth Sir Hector, his English
suddenly very precise, “you might begin to take an
interest in your own affairs, particularly your estates;
they are damnably mismanaged, I hear, more especially
at High Dering ... where you were born and your
mother died ... sweet soul!”</p>

<p>“High Dering!” repeated Sir John. “I’ faith it
seems a far cry to the old house—the green slopes of
Firle and our good South Downs! ’Tis long since we
saw ’em together, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Yes, John, it is seven years and more since you
left High Dering for London and the modish world.
And to-day, lad, instead of being a plain country
gentleman content in the prosperity of your tenants,
here you stand a man of fashion, a town gallant full
of polite airs and tricks and graces, but curst unhappy
by your looks—while High Dering is going to the
devil!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“’Tis mismanaged, you say, Hector? And yet
Sturton, my bailiff, seems to do very well——”</p>

<p>“Oh, excellent well, John, for you—and himself!
But ’tis vastly otherwise with your tenantry, I hear.”</p>

<p>“You contrive to hear a great deal, Hector, one
way or another!”</p>

<p>“No, just in the one way, lad, with my ears. Ye
see, Nature gi’e me eyes an’ lugs an’ I use ’em——”</p>

<p>“And you tell me Sturton is a rogue?”</p>

<p>“I say go and see for yourself, John. Get ye to
High Dering and look, John, listen—and act!”</p>

<p>“I will, Hector. The peace and quiet of the place
will be grateful, besides.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ll no’ find it sae peaceful, lad, nor yet sae quiet
whateffer!”</p>

<p>“Why, pray?” demanded Sir John, with sudden
interest.</p>

<p>“Well, John, ye’ll ken the name o’ Lord Sayle, I’m
thinkin’?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I do!” nodded Sir John, his interest
deepening. “I’ve heard he has ‘been out’ rather
frequently——”</p>

<p>“Losh, man, he has that! A wild, desp’rit, duelling
body wi’ reputation as unsavoury as—as y’r ain,
John, but wi’ this difference—he fights tae kill an’
generally pinks his man. He’s ane o’ y’r gentlemanly
rapscallions wha’ll insult ye vera politely, y’ ken, an’
kill ye vera genteelly into the bargain if ye dare tae
tak’ offence.”</p>

<p>“So I’ve heard; and what then, Hector?”</p>

<p>“John, the man’s leeving within half an hour’s
ride o’ y’r ain park gates. After killing the young
Marquis of Torwood last year, London grew too hot,
so my lord marched bag and baggage to his Sussex
estate, and there he’s lived ever since—aye, and a
place of unholy riot he keeps there, as I hear. An’
what’s more, John, what wi’ his desp’rit proneness tae
bluidshed, there’s few tae gainsay him, y’ ken—his
will is law in the South Country these days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“’S bud!” murmured Sir John. “’S life, but begin
to yearn for the country more than ever!”</p>

<p>“Hoot, laddie, hoot-toot, ye’ll no’ be sic a fule tae
pick a quarrel juist for y’r ain vanity an’ vainglory,
Johnnie? The man’s good a sworder as ye’sel’——”</p>

<p>Sir John laughed and, reaching up, straightened
Sir Hector’s periwig that had worked itself rather
more askew than usual.</p>

<p>“Tush, man!” said he. “Sure you know that
your true duellists take most particular pains to avoid
each other. Shall dog eat dog? And I detest bloodshed,
Hector. I prefer pen to sword—and that
reminds me we have not as yet determined on an apt
rhyme to ‘soul!’” And out came Sir John’s unfinished
script. “The work is in ode form, and, so
far as it goes, is well enough. Pray sit down, Hector;
the night is young—listen and judge for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Na, na, John!” answered Sir Hector, retreating
to the door. “I hae no ear for po’try, ye ken—so I’ll
awa’ tae bed and leave ye to’t, lad. But dinna sit
too long—for we maun be up betimes. Guid-night.”</p>

<p>Left alone, Sir John tossed the unfinished ode into
the fire and, having watched it flare to ash and vanish
up the wide chimney, sat awhile in thought. Gradually
the place above and around him grew hushed,
voices died away, busy feet grew still; the inn sank
to rest. But Sir John sat on staring into the dying
fire, deep-plunged in brooding thought. So lost was
he that he heard no sound of opening door, of light
footstep, until roused by a soft touch; he started
and glanced up, to behold her of whom he was
thinking.</p>

<p>Meekly she stood before him, clad for the road in a
long, hooded cloak, with a bundle in her hand, a very
small bundle tied up in a neckerchief.</p>

<p>“Rose!” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Here I be, sir,” she answered timidly. “An’ now
what will your honour please to do wi’ me?”</p>

<p>Instinctively Sir John arose, but stood mumchance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
for once in his life speechlessly perplexed; perceiving
which, she continued demurely:</p>

<p>“If your honour is ready to go, I am.”</p>

<p>“To go?” he repeated. “Aye, but whither, child?”</p>

<p>“I ... I thought you would know best, sir,” she
answered. “But wherever it be, the sooner we start
the better.”</p>

<p>“What’s your hurry, Rose?”</p>

<p>“’Tis my mistress, sir—the moment she misses me,
she’ll come a-galloping back to find me, y’ see; she do
rely on me for her curls an’ complexion, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” murmured Sir John, “two highly necessary
things to any woman o’ fashion! She will doubtless
fly back in quest of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Then pray let us go, sir.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but how? Here is no sort of conveyance
unless it be a posting nag. Can you ride, girl?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“A-pillion?”</p>

<p>“I should tumble off, sir.... But we’ve got legs,
your honour——”</p>

<p>“Limbs, child!”</p>

<p>“An’ I be a good walker an’ main strong, sir——”</p>

<p>“Aye, as a goddess o’ the groves and fountains,
Rose.”</p>

<p>“An’ ’tis a mortal fine night, your honour! And
look at the moon—so splendid an’ all!”</p>

<p>“Splendid indeed, Rose!” And, opening the lattice,
Sir John leaned out into a radiant night very calm
and still—breathed an air soft and fragrant, saw the
gleaming highway barred and fretted by the black
shadows of the sombre trees—a magically alluring road,
a way mysterious to woo the adventurous.</p>

<p>Sir John sighed and drew in his head.</p>

<p>“Y’ are very right, child; the sooner we start the
better! In the corner yonder you will find my cloak
and pistols; pray bring ’em whiles I scribble a line to
my friend.” And sitting down forthwith he took pen
and paper and indited the following epistle:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Hector</span>,—I have departed for England,
but will meet you in High Dering at the earliest moment,
where you shall inquire for one, John Derwent.
Meanwhile I am, as ever, thy wholly devoted, loving</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">John Derwent</span>.</p>

<p>“P.S.—I have taken the girl Rose with me.”</p>

</div>

<p>Having duly sealed and directed which missive, he
arose, took up his pistols, examined flint, charge and
priming and thrust them into the capacious pockets
of his riding-coat; then he enveloped himself in the
cloak, softly unbarred and opened the door and, hat
in hand, bowed his companion out of the silent inn.</p>

<p>“Come, child,” said he, “let us, confident in Fate
and each other, seek the unknown together, nothing
doubting.”</p>

<span class="smaller">OF SOULS, SOLITUDE AND A DUSTY ROAD</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Very soon they had lost sight of the inn and the
magic of the night was all about them, a night
of vasty stillness wherein the leaves hung motionless
and none moved but themselves, and with no sound
to break the slumberous quiet save the tread of their
feet. Before them stretched the tree-bordered road
leading away and away to distances vague and
mysterious, a silvery causeway fretted by purple-black
shadows, with, to right and left, a wide prospect of
rolling, wooded country.</p>

<p>Sir John walked in serene and silent contemplation
of earth and heaven until his companion, as though
awed by the all-pervading stillness, drew a little nearer
and spoke in hushed voice:</p>

<p>“’Tis dreadful solitary, sir!”</p>

<p>“It is, child,” he answered, his gaze still wandering;
“but mine is a nature that craves solitude and, at
times, I am possessed of a very passion for silence.”</p>

<p>“Is this why your honour went and lived in Paris?”
she questioned softly.</p>

<p>Sir John’s wandering gaze fixed itself rather hastily
upon the speaker, but her face was hidden in enveloping
hood.</p>

<p>“One can find solitude anywhere, Rose,” he retorted.</p>

<p>“Can one, sir?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, child! ’Mid the busiest throng, the
gayest crowd, one’s soul may sit immune, abstracted,
in solitary communion with the Infinite.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but—can souls sit, your honour?” she
questioned.</p>

<p>Once again Sir John’s roaming gaze focused itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
upon his companion, and when he spoke his voice
sounded a trifle pettish.</p>

<p>“’Twas but a figure of speech, girl! Souls, being abstractions,
ha’ no need to—tush! Why a plague should
we puzzle your pretty head with metaphysics? What
know you o’ the soul, child—or I, for that matter?”</p>

<p>“Not much, your honour,” she answered submissively.
“Though parson do say the soul is more
precious than much fine gold.”</p>

<p>“Have you a soul, I wonder, Rose?”</p>

<p>“I ... hope so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then look before you, child, and tell me what
you see.”</p>

<p>“A dusty road!” she sighed.</p>

<p>“And is it nothing more to you, girl? Doth it
strike no deeper note? Do you not see it as a path
mysterious, leading to the unknown—the very symbol
of life itself? And yet, poor child, how should you?”
he sighed. “Let us talk of simpler things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank ye kindly, sir,” she sighed. “An’ I should
like to hear about yourself, an’t please your honour.”</p>

<p>“Rose!” he exclaimed in sudden dubiety.</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour?”</p>

<p>“I ... I wish to heaven you would not muffle
your face in that pestilent hood!”</p>

<p>Mutely obedient, she pushed back the offending
headgear, and Sir John, beholding the stolid placidity
of her, the serene eyes and grave, unsmiling mouth,
grew a little reassured.</p>

<p>“Pray what would you learn of so simple a creature
as myself?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“As much as you’ll tell me, sir. ’Deed, I don’t even
know your honour’s name—except that ’tis John.”</p>

<p>“Then call me John.”</p>

<p>“Nay, sir, I couldn’t be so bold to take such
liberty! You a grand gentleman an’ me a poor maid
in service!”</p>

<p>“But I’m in service also, Rose,” he answered.
“Indeed we all are, more or less. I particularly so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“You!” she exclaimed, turning to stare at him.
“You in service! Who with?”</p>

<p>“A rather difficult, very exacting person named Sir
John Dering.”</p>

<p>“Him!” she cried, and immediately began to
walk faster than before. “But,” she questioned
suddenly, stopping to view him up and down, “but—your
grand clothes?”</p>

<p>“His, Rose! Sir John’s—borrowed for the
occasion!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed, and walked on again.</p>

<p>“As for my name, you’ll find I shall answer readily
to John Derwent.”</p>

<p>“John?” she repeated. “’Tis the same as your
master’s!”</p>

<p>“You may call me ‘Jack,’” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Being Sir John Dering’s servant, you will know
all about him and his evil ways?”</p>

<p>“None better, child.”</p>

<p>“Is he so wicked as they tell?”</p>

<p>“Faith, child, no man could be; ’twere beyond
all finite achievement, and Sir John is only
human!”</p>

<p>“But,” said she, her eyes fiercely accusing, “he—murders
men!”</p>

<p>“Not often, child,” he answered lightly.</p>

<p>“He fights duels!”</p>

<p>“But only when necessary.”</p>

<p>“He hath broke poor women’s hearts!”</p>

<p>“Only such as were cracked.”</p>

<p>“You are his champion, it seems?”</p>

<p>“Because he hath none other—a poor, lonely dog
with a bad name, child, a solitary creature for the
kicks and buffets o’ the world! Doth not your
woman’s heart yearn to such?”</p>

<p>But instead of answering she clasped his arm in
sudden terror.</p>

<p>“Look!” she whispered. “There’s something there
... moving in the shadows—a man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“Two men, child!” he whispered back. “I’ve
been watching ’em for some time.”</p>

<p>“What ... what will they do to us?”</p>

<p>“That depends. Art afraid, child?”</p>

<p>“Yes ... yes——” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Then pretend you are not—as I do! Come, step
out, and go on talking.”</p>

<p>As they walked on thus she, stealing terrified glances,
saw how these vague yet sinister shapes began gradually
edging towards them, nearer and nearer, crouching
forms that moved on soundless feet—closer and closer,
until she had a vision of sordid, skulking, ragged
misery, of murderous desperation, hunger-fierce eyes,
the grim silhouette of a bludgeon, the evil gleam of
a stealthy knife——</p>

<p>And then, with sudden, swift leap, Sir John was
upon them, and she saw him fronting them, a pistol
thrust into each pallid, shrinking face——</p>

<p>“Rose!” he called. “Rose, come hither, child!”</p>

<p>Instinctively, and despite the terror that shook her,
she obeyed. “Good girl!” quoth he, with an approving
nod. “I’ the right-hand pocket o’ my waistcoat
you will find five or six guineas; take two and bestow
’em upon the poor rascals for affording us a sensation.”
Trembling still, she carried out Sir John’s instructions,
who, with a brief word and imperious gesture, commanded
the astonished rogues begone. Nor did they need
a second bidding, but flitted away on silent feet, though
oft turning pallid faces to stare their amazement ere
they vanished into the shadows whence they came.</p>

<p>“Rose, child,” quoth Sir John, uncocking and repocketing
his pistols, “I am pleased with thee. ’S
heart, I’m vastly pleased with thee! I rejoice that
being fearful you commanded your fear and neither
shrieked, swooned, squeaked, moaned, laughed, wept
or fell to a fit o’ the vapours. Thank God, child, that
thou’rt a fine, buxom, lusty country wench, sound o’
wind and limb, all wholesome flesh and blood and
bone——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, fie—hush and ha’ done!” she exclaimed,
tossing her handsome head. “You make me sound
as I were a prize cow!”</p>

<p>“Tush!” he laughed. “I do but take your body
first. As to your mind——”</p>

<p>“I ha’ none—so never mind!” she retorted bitterly,
and making the most of her stately height.</p>

<p>“Aye, but I do mind,” he answered seriously. “I
mind infinitely, because ’tis your mind needeth a great
deal o’ painful care. ’S life, girl, were your mind
the peer o’ your body you’d be a creature without peer.
The which, sounding paradoxical, is yet very truth.”</p>

<p>“’Stead of which,” she retorted angrily, “I am
only a buxom country wench ... a poor maid, as you
think, all body an’ no soul, an’ talk of as she were a
piece o’ cattle! Oh, I could cry wi’ shame, I could!”</p>

<p>“Then I shall kiss you, Rose!”</p>

<p>“You—ah, you wouldn’t dare!”</p>

<p>“Not unless you cry, child. I can endure a
woman’s scorn, her fleerings, even her caresses—but
her tears melt my adamantine fortitude quite. So
pray do not weep, Rose. And as for your sweet
country ways, your rustic simplicity, God bless you
for ’em, child. With your goddess-form uncramped by
cursed, ’prisoning whalebone—with no rusks or busks
or such damned contrivances to pinch your figure
to the prevailing mode you are as the hand of Nature
moulded you, a woman apt to motherhood, and therefore
to be reverenced ... and a curse on all rusks.”</p>

<p>“They are called busks, your honour, and I wear
’em!” she retorted.</p>

<p>“Howbeit, as you walk beside me now, Rose, free-limbed
as a nymph, fragrant with naught but health,
you are a thousand times more alluring than any
modish lady laced to suffocation and ready to sink,
to swoon, to languish and vapour accordingly on the
least provocation.”</p>

<p>“I ’spose you’ve endured a vast deal o’ such ladylike
weaknesses, sir?” she questioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“To an infinity o’ weariness!” sighed Sir John.
“That is to say, my master hath, and I ha’ suffered
with him.”</p>

<p>“Your master be a great beau, my mistress says,
and mighty successful wi’ the ladies—French ladies!
But my mistress do say as Sir John Dering’s nothing in
particular to look at—a plain, insignificant little man!”</p>

<p>“Insignificant, girl!” Sir John nearly tripped
over one of his spurs. “Insignificant!” he repeated.
“Oh, begad! But then, child, ’twas easy to recognise
your mistress for a person of little taste and no discernment,
poor soul! An insignificant little man!”
he repeated for the second time, and then laughed
joyously. “And yet, Rose, sink me but she’s right!”
quoth he. “For in many particulars you behold in
me the very reverse and opposite of Sir John Dering.”</p>

<p>“And yet his clothes do fit ’ee to admiration!” she
added.</p>

<p>“Hum!” quoth Sir John, and walked in silence
awhile and, beholding the moon near to setting, sighed;
as her tender light waned, his gloom waxed, for the
countryside seemed to lose something of its magic
allurement; moreover, his long riding-boots, elegantly
light though they were, began to irk him, and the faint,
monotonous jingle of his spurs irritated him so that
at last he must needs pause to unbuckle them.</p>

<p>“A pedestrian in spurs is a pitiable object, Rose,”
he explained, “and their jingle upon a toilsome road
is deuced dismal!”</p>

<p>“An’ I be that weary I could weep!” she sighed.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” he admonished. “Your weariness I can
endure with an effort, but your tears—— There, take
my arm, child, lean on me—so!”</p>

<p>“An’ I don’t know where you’m a-takin’ me.”</p>

<p>“To England, sure!” he answered encouragingly.
“To Sussex, to the gentle Down-country—home!”</p>

<p>“You can’t!” she sighed. “Ye see, I ha’ no
home.”</p>

<p>“Your mother—father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“I—I’m an orphan wi’ no one in the world—except
a grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Then your grandmother be it.”</p>

<p>“Her’ll only clout me for leaving my lady an’ losing
a good place. And you—you’d be glad to be quit o’
me already.”</p>

<p>“My poor child,” said he in changed tone, becoming
aware how painfully she limped, “you are worn out!”</p>

<p>“And your voice sounded kind!” she answered,
turning to look at him; and he saw the cold, austere
beauty of her face transfigured by a sudden tenderness
so new and unexpected that he was amazed.</p>

<p>“Why—why, Rose,” he stammered, “you can be
more—much more than merely handsome.”</p>

<p>“See,” she whispered, “the moon’s a’most down—’twill
be dark soon!”</p>

<p>“Nay, child, in a little ’twill be dawn; you have
walked with me all night. And this is the most
desolate part of the road as I remember—never an
inn, or cottage or bed for you, my poor girl!”</p>

<p>“The ditch will serve,” she sighed, “for indeed I
can go no farther.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I will lodge you better than that ... there’s
a haystack i’ the field yonder, if you can walk so far?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try!” said she between her teeth; but, catching
her foot in a wheel rut, she staggered and uttered
a cry of pain. And then Sir John had caught her up
in his arms and bore her, albeit very unsteadily, across
the stretch of meadow. Reeling and stumbling, he
reached the haystack at last, and, setting her down,
leaned to gasp and catch his breath.</p>

<p>“A goddess is ... an awkward burden ... for
a ... mere human man!” he panted.</p>

<p>“Especially if she be ‘buxom!’” she added, with a
little unsteady laugh. “Oh, but you are kind! And
stronger than you look! I shouldn’t ha’ let you ...
but me so tired ... and the pain! I think I shall
cry!”</p>

<p>“Aye, do!” he pleaded, and reached for her hands.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
But she laughed instead, and bade him show her
where she must sleep. Therefore Sir John tossed
off his cloak, and by dint of some labour had soon
burrowed a niche in the stack where she might lie
softly couched on fragrant hay.</p>

<p>Being within this niche and Sir John going to cover
her with his long riding-cloak, she would have none of
it unless he shared it with her; so at last down they
lay side by side.</p>

<p>“Close your eyes and go to sleep, child!” he
murmured. “Sleep you secure ... for I ... will
watch ... awhile....” But, even as he spoke, his
eyes closed and he sank to heavenly slumber. Yet
after some while he awoke, conscious of an intolerable
unease, and, groping for the cause, found himself
lying upon a pistol. The day was breaking, and by
the gathering light he saw this pistol for none of his;
a small, silver-mounted weapon, very apt for concealment—say
in the folds of a long grey cloak.</p>

<p>She lay deep-plunged in slumber, her face concealed
by the hood of this same grey cloak and naught to see
of her save one hand, a slim, shapely hand, very white
and delicate; observing which hand, its pink, soft
palm, its long, taper fingers and rosy, polished nails,
Sir John’s eyes grew suddenly keen, his lips grim
as, lying down again, he stared on the brightening
dawn; slowly his grim look vanished and, smiling
enigmatically, he fell asleep again.</p>

<p>And presently up came the sun to transform a myriad
dewdrops into so many scintillating gems and make a
glory of the world; to rouse the birds and fill them
with the gladness of a new day; to kiss the slumberous
eyes of her who stirred sighfully in the comfort of her
grey cloak, and waking to a glory of sunshine and
carolling birds, sat up suddenly, peering eager-eyed
at him who lay beside her very fast asleep and with
a faint, enigmatic smile upon his lips.</p>

<span class="smaller">WHICH INTRODUCES MY LORD SAYLE AND THE CLASH OF STEEL</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Sir John rubbed the sleep from his eyes to behold
his companion approaching, evidently fresh
from her morning ablutions; moreover, her sprigged
petticoat, if a little rumpled, looked surprisingly trim,
her square-toed, flat-heeled shoes were innocent of
dust and she had even contrived to comb and dress
her hair—black, glossy hair, he noticed, that fell in
wanton curls on either white temple. And, seeing her
so neat and trig from top to toe, he immediately
became supremely conscious of his own rumpled
garments, his unshaven chin and the haystalks
entwined in the tangled ringlets of his peruke. None
the less, he rose and bowed with his usual grace,
giving her a cheery “Good morning.”</p>

<p>“’S heart, child!” he exclaimed, “you walk proud
as Dian’s self or lady o’ high degree, God save your
ladyship!” And he bowed again with an exaggerated
flourish, at which she frowned and answered sullenly:</p>

<p>“You’m asleep and dreaming, I think!”</p>

<p>“Aye, belike I am, wench,” he answered gaily.
“I dream you sweet, gentle and great o’ soul—and
dreams ever go by contrary, for thy looks are sour, thy
speech ungracious and thy soul—ha, thy soul, child!”</p>

<p>“What of’t?”</p>

<p>“’Tis the unknown quantity! How, dost frown
yet, my Rose? Is it for anger or hunger?</p>

<p class="noindent">—bethink thee, Rose, the joys in store—ham, beef,
beer ... base material things to appal the soul and
yet—how comfortable, how irresistible to your human
maid and man! So ha’ patience, sweet wench, ha’
patience till I have laved me, combed me and found
us an inn. Meantime sit ye and list to the birds,
commune you with Nature whiles I go wash in the
brook yonder.”</p>

<p>And away he strode, blithe and debonair despite
the straws in his wig, leaving her to bite red underlip
and frown after him until a clump of willows hid him
from view. Then, coming to the niche in the haystack,
she began to seek in angry haste, wholly unconscious
that Sir John was watching her from his screen of
leaves, keen-eyed, and with the enigmatical smile
curling his grim mouth. Thereafter he proceeded
with his toilet at a leisured ease.</p>

<p>So long was he indeed that she came thither impatiently
at last, to find him seated upon grassy bank,
his great periwig upon one fist, doing his best to
smooth its rebellious disorder with an ivory pocket-comb
of pitifully inadequate proportions.</p>

<p>“Are ye going to be all day?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” he sighed, tugging at a refractory
tangle.</p>

<p>“You’ll never do it that way, fool!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Your pardon, madam,” he answered gravely, “but
I shall, if I sit here till the trump o’ doom——”</p>

<p>“You’re a nice gentleman’s servant!” quoth she
scornfully. “You don’t even know how to use a
comb——”</p>

<p>“I have my own method!” he retorted.</p>

<p>Her answer was to snatch the wig, pluck from him
the comb and show him with contemptuous elaboration
how it should be done, while Sir John, leaning
back against a convenient tree, watched her with
respectful interest.</p>

<p>“If I had only thought to bring a razor!” he
murmured, feeling his stubbly chin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“You look mighty ordinary without your wig!”
said she, viewing him with coldly disparaging glance.
“Very ordinary ... and insignificant!”</p>

<p>Sir John sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p>“No man is a hero to his valet!” he answered,
whereat she tossed wig and comb at his feet and
turned her back on him.</p>

<p>Sir John put on his peruke, settled it with nicest
care, stroked the long, glossy curls, and rose.</p>

<p>“Many thanks!” quoth he. “But for my chin I
should feel well-nigh respectable. And now permit
me to return this trifle, which ’tis likely you have
been diligently a-seeking.”</p>

<p>Glancing round, she saw that he was tendering the
silver-mounted pistol. “I found myself lying upon
it as I slept,” he explained. “’Tis a pretty toy, yet
deadly enough—at close quarters. ’Twas vastly wise
in you to arm you before trusting yourself to—my
honour. I commend your extreme discretion. It
must be a comfort to you to know you can blow my
head off whenever you think necessary, or feel so
disposed! Come, take your pistol, child—take it!”
But, seeing she merely frowned, he thrust the weapon
into the pocket of her cloak whether she would or
no.</p>

<p>“So there you stand, Rose,” he smiled, “thrice,
nay, four times armed—by your prayers, your little
cross, a pistol and ... your innocence! ’Faith,
child, you should be safe enough o’ conscience! Come,
then, let us go seek breakfast.”</p>

<p>And now as they trudged along he talked of birds
and the wayside flowers, of which it seemed he knew
much; but finding she only frowned or yawned as
the whim took her, he quickened his pace.</p>

<p>“Why will ye hurry a body so—I be all breathless!”
she protested at last.</p>

<p>“I would haste to feed you, sweet Rose; ’twill
render you less thorny, mayhap—and a little better
company.” At this she stopped to frown and clench<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
her fists, whereupon he promptly seized the nearest
and patted it kindly.</p>

<p>“A pretty hand, Rose,” said he, “a slim, white,
soft, shapely little hand, and yet useful for all its idle
looks.”</p>

<p>“I hate you!” she exclaimed bitterly.</p>

<p>“God bless you, child, I believe you do!” he
answered. “But the birds sing, the sun shines, and
I shall enjoy my breakfast none the less, which, if I
remember this road aright, is none so far to seek!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, rounding a bend, they presently espied
a large posting-inn astir with bustle and excitement;
horses stamped, chains rattled, ostlers ran to and fro,
voices shouted; from all of which it was to be surmised
that important company had lately arrived or
was about to depart.</p>

<p>Threading his way through all this confusion, Sir
John beckoned to a large and somewhat pompous
person.</p>

<p>“Landlord,” quoth he, “three-quarters of an hour
hence you will have a coach and post-horses at the
door. Meanwhile—breakfast!”</p>

<p>Sir John was his usual gentle, imperious self—but
his chin was unshaven, his boots and clothes dusty;
wherefore mine host’s bow was perfunctory and his
manner somewhat off-hand when he “regretted he
was unable to oblige Monsieur, as the only fresh team
of horses was already commanded for a great English
milord—it was distressing, mais que voulez-vous!
As for breakfast, it was to be had within—Monsieur
must pray excuse him, he was busy!” Sir John,
completely forgetful of clothes and chin, was staring
amazed and a little shocked by the landlord’s extraordinary
lack of respectful and instant obedience,
when his companion twitched him by embroidered
cuff and, turning, he wondered to surprise a look on
her face that might have been exultation, and there
was suppressed excitement in her voice and gesture
as she pointed to a coat-of-arms emblazoned upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
panels of an elegant travelling-chariot that stood
near by.</p>

<p>“Look yonder!” said she. “Oh, ’tis small use you
expecting horses if this English lord wants ’em. Ye
see, I know who he is—look there!”</p>

<p>“A vulgar display of paint!” nodded Sir John,
glancing at the coat-of-arms. “Pray what of it?”</p>

<p>“That coach belongs to my Lord Sayle!”</p>

<p>“And pray, what then?”</p>

<p>“When he wants anything he generally gets it,”
she answered.</p>

<p>“And why is he so cursed, child?”</p>

<p>“Because nobody dare gainsay him!”</p>

<p>Now hearing the taunt in her voice, reading it in
her look, Sir John’s blue eyes grew suddenly very
keen and bright, then he laughed a little bitterly.</p>

<p>“You think ’tis time one dared the fellow, perhaps.
Ah, Rose, had we Sir John Dering with us, were my
master here——”</p>

<p>“’Twould be a new experience for him to meet—a
dangerous man!” she retorted.</p>

<p>“Indeed, child, you grow a little bloodthirsty, I
think!” he sighed. “Rest you here a moment. I
must speak a word with master landlord.”</p>

<p>Left alone, she stood to stare after Sir John’s slender,
light-treading figure, then, turning about, entered the
inn.</p>

<p>The place was full of stir and bustle, so, pulling her
hood about her face, she mounted the stair, but paused
at sound of riotous merriment from a room near by;
she was standing thus hesitant, when a vigorous arm
was clasped suddenly about her and, all in a moment,
she was half-carried, half-dragged to a certain door
which, swinging wide, discovered three gentlemen at
their wine, chief among them one who sat at the
head of the table, resplendent in sky-blue coat and
flaxen periwig that framed a handsome, arrogant face,
bold of eye, full-lipped and square of chin; a gentleman
who bore himself with a masterful air and who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
now, setting down his glass, leant suddenly forward
to stare at her who stood shrinking beneath the fixity
of his gaze.</p>

<p>“By Venus and all the Loves!” he exclaimed.
“Whom ha’ you there, Huntley?”</p>

<p>“A bird o’ price, Sayle! Ha’n’t I caught a pretty
bird, then?”</p>

<p>“Smite me!” exclaimed his lordship, viewing the
captive in growing amaze. “Burn me if I ever saw
such a resemblance! She might be the proud Barrasdaile
herself were she a little less vulgarly robust—less
redundant in her curves, d’ye see. Bring her
hither, Huntley man!”</p>

<p>“Damme, no, Sayle—she’s mine!”</p>

<p>“Damme, yes, sir, she belongs to all! In her we
greet her bewitching prototype, in her rustical image
we’ll adore and pay homage to her of whom she is
the very spit, the breathing likeness—‘the Barrasdaile’
herself. Since the haughty beauty is beyond
our reach, this countrified semblance of her shall serve
our turn ... she’s a dainty creature, I vow, with
ruddy lips ... a waist ... a shape! Bring her
hither, man! Nay—up on the table with her! Aye
so, throned on the table she shall receive our worship!”</p>

<p>Despite struggles, supplications and bitter reproaches,
she was hoisted to the table amid a hubbub
of cheers and laughter and, standing thus, faced them—a
wild creature, trembling with shame, rage and a
growing fear.</p>

<p>And it was now that Sir John chose to open the
door, pausing on the threshold, snuff-box in hand, to
survey the scene with an expression of cold and
passionless disgust until the company, a little taken
aback by his sudden appearance, ceased their clamorous
merriment to frown with one accord upon the intruder,
and fiercest of all, my Lord Sayle.</p>

<p>“What the devil?” he demanded. “This is a
private room, sir—get out and be damned!”</p>

<p>Sir John smiled, closed the door and leaned his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
back against it, whereat were murmurs and mutterings
of angry surprise, and my Lord Sayle rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Damme, is the fellow drunk or mad!... What
d’ye want?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Horses!” answered Sir John and, smiling affably
at the angry company, helped himself to a pinch of
snuff. And now the trembling captive, finding herself
thus momentarily forgotten, sprang from the table
and was at Sir John’s elbow all in a moment; but he
never so much as glanced at her, all his interest centred
apparently in the flaxen curls of my Lord Sayle’s wig.
“I am here, sir,” he went on, closing and fobbing his
snuff-box, “to inform you that, learning you had
engaged the only horses available, and deeming my
own need of ’em the more urgent, I have taken the
liberty of countermanding the animals to my own
use.”</p>

<p>At this was a moment’s amazed stillness, then my
lord laughed fiercely and leaned across the table to
glare, his nostrils unpleasantly dilated.</p>

<p>“You are assuredly an ignorant fool, sir,” quoth
he, “for ’tis certain you do not—cannot know me!”</p>

<p>“Nor desire to, sir!” murmured Sir John.</p>

<p>“I am Sayle—Lord Sayle! You’ll have heard the
name, I fancy?”</p>

<p>“And mine, my lord, is Derwent, and you will never
have heard it, I am sure. But what has all this to
do with horses, pray?”</p>

<p>“This, my poor imbecile—and hark’ee, Mr. Derwent,
I permit no man, or woman either for that matter, to
thwart my whims, much less an unshaven young
jackanapes like yourself! Therefore—and mark me!
Unless you apologise instantly for your unbelievable
impertinence and undertake to personally see that the
horses are put to my chariot within the next ten
minutes, I shall give myself the pleasure of horse-whipping
you, here and now, before your trollop’s
pretty face. Come, Mr. Derwent, what d’ye say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Sir John’s answer was characteristically gentle:
“I say, my lord, that your manners are as gross as
your person, and your person is infinitely offensive
from any and every point o’ view!”</p>

<p>Here ensued a moment of stupefied silence, a stillness
wherein none moved for a space; suddenly my
lord’s chair went over with a crash, his clenched fists
smote the air. “Lock the door, Amberley, lock the
door,” he commanded in choking voice, “and give
me a whip, somebody!”</p>

<p>“A whip?” repeated Sir John, faintly surprised.
“Nay, sir, you have a sword, sure? And rumour says
you can use it. Come, pray let us try what you can
do, though first we will ask the child here to be good
enough to leave us awhile——”</p>

<p>“Ha, leave us, is it?” snarled my lord. “Damme,
no; I say the handsome baggage shall stay to see you
squirm! The table, gentlemen ... give me room!”</p>

<p>Very soon, sufficient space having been cleared to
satisfy his lordship, he tugged off the sky-blue coat,
tossed it aside, kicked off his shoes and, laughing in
arrogant assurance, drew his sword and stood waiting.
Sir John made his dispositions with a leisured ease
that set my lord swearing in vicious impatience, while
his friends snuffed, nodded and watched the victim
prepare himself for the inevitable outcome with more
or less sympathy; in especial one, a long-legged,
sleepy gentleman who, unheeding Lord Sayle’s angry
glare, approached Sir John and bowed.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, “m’ name’s Amberley. It seems
y’ave no friend t’act for ye in case of—ah—of——”</p>

<p>“My sudden demise?” smiled Sir John.</p>

<p>“Precisely, sir. If you should wish any message
d’livered t’any one—any commission o’ the kind, shall
be happy t’offer myself—name of Amberley, sir.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Amberley, pray receive my thanks, but I have
no message for any one——”</p>

<p>“Damnation!” cried my lord. “Is he ready,
Amberley?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>“Quite!” murmured Sir John, and drawing his
sword he tossed the scabbard upon the table, and
approaching Lord Sayle, saluted and fell to his guard.</p>

<p>Slimmer than usual he looked as he stood thus gracefully
poised, and of no great stature, yet, in that
moment, observing his eyes and mouth, no one would
have called him “insignificant”—especially one who
leaned against the door, hands clenched, eyes wide,
waiting for what was to be.</p>

<p>The narrow blades crossed, and immediately rose
a thud of quick-moving, purposeful feet and clink of
murderous steel. Lord Sayle’s onset was impetuous
as usual, his attacks viciously direct and powerful;
but time and again his darting point was met, his
lightning thrusts parried, though only just in time,
and as if more by accident than skill; noting which,
he laughed scornfully and pressed his attack more
fiercely; twice he forced Sir John to break ground
until, espying an opening in his antagonist’s defence
after a wide parade, he lounged swiftly, gasped and,
dropping his weapon, staggered with Sir John’s blade
transfixing his sword-arm from wrist to elbow.</p>

<p>And now was confusion: a wild ringing of bells,
calling for water and sponges, running for lint and
bandages, while Sir John did on his shoes, and eased
himself into his tight-fitting riding-coat.</p>

<p>My Lord Sayle, a-sprawl in arm-chair while his
friends washed and stanched his wounds, alternately
cursed and groaned, heaping his late antagonist with
passionate revilings and bitter invective until, what
with anger and pain, his voice failed him at last.</p>

<p>Then Sir John spoke in chilling scorn:</p>

<p>“Thou contemptible thing! Thou man of straw!
Egad, and can it be you set all London by the ears?
’S life, my lord, your fencing is like your manners,
exceeding indifferent. I might ha’ killed you any
time I wished!”</p>

<p>My Lord Sayle struggled to his feet, raving like a
madman and calling for his sword, until, constrained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
by his friends, he sank back in the chair and suffered
their ministrations, but raving still.</p>

<p>“You shall suffer for this.... Aye, burn me, but
you shall! This is but the beginning ... we meet
again ... aye, by all the fiends in hell I’ll ha’ your
life for this ... you shall fight me again so soon as
I am able!”</p>

<p>“With joy, my lord!” answered Sir John, wiping
his blade on his lordship’s sky-blue coat that chanced
to lie handy. “’Twas purely for this reason that I
suffered you to live. Indeed, my lord, I hope to
repeat the pleasure of this little <i>rencontre</i> on every
possible occasion until I run you out of England.
And you should soon be well, for your wound, though
painful, is nothing dangerous. One word more, my
lord: as regards your sword-play, I should advise a
few lessons at your weapon against our next meeting.
Au revoir! Gentlemen, your servant!” Then, having
bowed to the silent company, Sir John reached out
his hand to her who stood leaning against the door.
“Come, child!” said he, and led her out of the
room, closing the door behind them; then she
stopped to face him, her eyes bright, her ruddy lips
a-quiver.</p>

<p>“Why ... why did you fight—that beast?” she
questioned breathlessly.</p>

<p>“’Faith, Rose, you heard! ’Twas in the matter of
post-horses.”</p>

<p>“Horses!” she repeated. “And naught else?”</p>

<p>“Naught i’ the world, child.”</p>

<p>“Horses!” she panted, in sudden vehement scorn.
“And you saw how he would have shamed me! You
saw! But then, to be sure, I am but a country wench
of none account.... I am merely a poor, friendless
girl ... but horses you can fight for, peril your life
for, because——”</p>

<p>“Because horses are—horses, child, and the horse,
you’ll remember, is a noble animal, man’s faithful
friend and servant——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, between clenched teeth. “Oh, I
hate—despise you—Sir John Dering!”</p>

<p>“Ah, Rose child!” sighed he. “Hast found me
out so soon? ‘What’s in a name?’ quoth the bard.
Alack, a vasty deal! say I. For, ‘Give a dog a bad
name and hang him!’ runs the proverb, and methinks
’tis true. So alack for poor Sir John Dering, whose
name and reputation are beyond repair and might
hang a thousand dogs. But thou’rt hungry, child,
and so is poor Sir John. Come, then, haste we to
breakfast!”</p>

<p>But she never stirred, only she turned her back
suddenly.</p>

<p>“What, Rose?” he exclaimed. “Why, child,
you’re never going to weep?”</p>

<p>“No!” she answered. “No!” and sobbed immediately.</p>

<p>Then Sir John turned her to face him, took her
bowed head between his two hands, lifted it and kissed
her upon the brow with a very reverent gentleness.</p>

<p>“Rose, child ... sweet innocence,” he sighed.
“Never forget you ha’ been kissed by the ‘Wicked
Dering.’ And now, come your ways to breakfast!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">OF A POST-CHAISE, INIQUITY AND A GRANDMOTHER</span></h2>

</div>

<p>From blazing noon to twilight, from twilight to
dusky eve, the lumbering coach had lurched and
jolted its slow, laborious way, the ponderous wheels
now rumbling over some bridge or culvert, now rattling
upon loose, stony ways, now ploughing, well-nigh
silent, through muffling dust. And my Lady Herminia
Barrasdaile, pushing back the hood of her grey cloak,
yawned frequently and unashamedly, for she was weary
of it all and more especially of her slumberous and
annoyingly silent companion; the whole adventure
was become disappointingly ordinary, and she heartily
wished herself done with it.</p>

<p>At last, from his shadowy corner, Sir John spoke,
and his voice sounded surprisingly wide awake:</p>

<p>“Art still asleep, child?”</p>

<p>“Is your honour pleased to be awake at last?” she
retorted in bitter irony.</p>

<p>“Nay, Rose, whilst you slept I have sat here musing
upon the mutability o’ human affairs. We are straws
i’ the wind, child, leaves a-whirl upon the stream of
life, borne hither and yon at Fate’s irrevocable decree.
What is to be, will be, let us strive and struggle how
we will. And ’twill soon be dark, so ha’ your pistol
ready——”</p>

<p>“I—I do not fear the dark!” she answered, quite
forgetting to yawn.</p>

<p>“Nay, ’tis not of the dark I warn you but of myself,
child!” he sighed. “Great pity is it you should ha’
found me out so soon, for as John Derwent I was in
every sense a gentle, worthy and reverent soul, but—as
Sir John Dering, ’tis a vastly different matter, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the censorious world expects me to live up to, or down
to, my reputation, so ha’ your pistol ready, girl!”</p>

<p>“I do not—fear you either!” she retorted.</p>

<p>“Aha, Rose? You think this bad dog’s bark is
worse than his bite? You mayhap think of me as——”</p>

<p>“Of you, sir?” she exclaimed. “Nay, indeed, I
think of—of my grandmother!”</p>

<p>“Her grandmother!” murmured Sir John. “Stupendous!
In a dark coach, on a solitary road and with
Iniquity threatening to pounce, she thinks of her grandmother!
Oh, admirable Rose! And a grandmother,
moreover, who will perchance clout the poor child!
And yet the poor child should benefit thereby, for a
clout in time saves nine. And yet—her grandmother!
Iniquity, hide thy diminished head! Wickedness, abase
thyself! John Dering, thou merciless profligate, forget
thy so innocent, trembling victim and go to sleep;
thy base designs are foiled by Innocence and a grandmother!
So droop Depravity, despair Debauchery—sleep,
John, sleep!” And Sir John yawned, stretched
his legs, drew his cloak and, settling himself to his
comfort, forthwith composed himself to slumber.</p>

<p>But it seemed my lady had no mind to permit this,
for she tapped the floor with insistent foot, fidgeted
with the blind, let down the window and closed it
again noisily. But Sir John, having closed his eyes,
kept them fast shut; whereupon my lady turned her
back upon him pettishly, and frowned at the rising
moon. But presently she stole a glance at her companion,
and judging him truly asleep, slipped back her
hood, shook her curls and slowly, gently, suffered herself
to sway over towards him until her head was pillowed
beside his. And after some while Sir John, vaguely
conscious of a persistent tickling, opened drowsy
eyes to find this occasioned by a lock of hair that
stirred upon his cheek. Slowly and with infinite
caution he drew a small leather case from his pocket,
whence he abstracted a pair of scissors and therewith
deftly snipped off this errant curl and, tucking it safely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
out of sight, returned the case to his pocket and
closed his eyes again.</p>

<p>Was she asleep? Her breathing was deep and soft
and regular, but—was she truly asleep? To ascertain
which fact he needs must edge himself round, though
with elaborate care not to disturb her. And surely
no slumber ever looked more unconsciously natural!...
Yet she lay in the one and only posture where the
rising moon might show him the classic beauty of her
profile, the low brow, the delicate nose, vivid lips
tenderly apart, the softly rounded chin.</p>

<p>Sir John scrutinised her, feature by feature, with
such keen intensity that it seemed to trouble her
dreams, for she sighed plaintively at last, stirred
gracefully and finally, opening her eyes, sat up to
smooth and pat her rebellious hair.</p>

<p>“Have I been asleep, sir?”</p>

<p>“’Tis what I’m wondering, Rose,” he answered,
seating himself opposite to her. “Howbeit you did
it charmingly well. And now, since we are both
awake, let us converse of your grandmother——”</p>

<p>“Pray when shall we reach Dieppe?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Some time ’twixt now and dawn, if all goes well.
But tell me of your grandmother.”</p>

<p>Instead of answering, she turned to stare out of
the window, and became so intensely unconscious of
him that Sir John yawned again, and subsided into
lethargic silence. So they rumbled and jolted on their
weary way until the grind of wheels and creak of the
leathern springs grew unbearable.</p>

<p>“Are ye asleep again?” she demanded at last.</p>

<p>“Nay, m’ sweet creature,” he answered drowsily.
“I ruminate upon thyself and myself and will make
thee a prophecy, as thus: Within the week, Paris,
aye, and London belike, will ring wi’ news of this my
latest infamy; the modish world will have its ears
tickled by scandalous tale of how the ‘Wicked Dering’
carried off to shameful purpose a poor, pretty, sweet
and innocent serving-wench.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“But how—how should any one know?” she
questioned a little breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Alas, my Rose,” he sighed, “do I but sneeze the
world hears on’t. I am dogged by a most unrelenting
and scandal-mongering fate.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by fate?”</p>

<p>“A woman, Rose, a lady o’ high degree who hath
constituted herself my determined though somewhat
hysterical Nemesis. She dedicated me to her vengeance
five weary years ago, and ever since, when moved
to by splenetic humours, for she is a vaporish lady,
she hath wrought to such purpose that here am I
fleeing back home to marry her——”</p>

<p>“To ... oh ... to ... marry her?”</p>

<p>“Precisely! Why d’ye gasp, child?”</p>

<p>“But if she hath been ... is ... your enemy——”</p>

<p>“I will make her wife to the ‘Wicked Dering’!”</p>

<p>“Are you so—so sure you can?”</p>

<p>“As sure as life, Rose!”</p>

<p>“Life is a thing most uncertain, I’ve heard, Sir John!”</p>

<p>“Aye, but not till we’re dead, Rose.”</p>

<p>“But how if she refuse you?”</p>

<p>“I ha’n’t troubled to think o’ that.”</p>

<p>“Do you know her well?”</p>

<p>“So little that I have small doubts.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? And how if she utterly scorn and contemn
you? How if she make a mock o’ you? How
if she bid her servants drive you from her presence?”</p>

<p>“Don’t gnash your pretty teeth, child! And if she
so despitefully use me then should I come a-seeking
thee, my Rose——”</p>

<p>“Me?” she stammered. “You—you’d come—to me?”</p>

<p>“’Tis most certain!” he answered. “But not as
the notorious Sir John; ’twould be as the meek, the
gentle and reverent John Derwent I should woo until
I won thee at last, sweet Rose o’ love. Do but think
on me as John Derwent and I will begin e’en now,
humbly, tenderly, as only John Derwent might woo
thee, thou fragrant Innocency.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>“And what of—her—your enemy?”</p>

<p>“We would leave her to her vengeance, child,
whiles thou and I——” Sir John paused suddenly to
listen. “Rose,” said he, “d’ye hear aught?” And
presently, sure enough, above the never-ceasing
rumble of wheels, creaking of springs and jingle of
harness, they distinguished the rhythmic throb of
oncoming, galloping hoofs.</p>

<p>“Horsemen!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“One!” he corrected. “And do not be alarmed,
it may be a friend—and yet it may not!”</p>

<p>Saying which, Sir John reached down one of his pistols
from the slings and, lowering the window, leaned out.</p>

<p>The moon was sinking, but by her diminished light
he descried a solitary horseman who galloped hard in
the dust of their wheels, and, dim-seen though he was
in consequence, it needed but one glance at his height
and width to reassure Sir John, who immediately
called to his driver to stop; and very soon the horseman
was alongside.</p>

<p>“What—Hector!” exclaimed Sir John joyously.
“So you’ve caught us, have ye? A thousand
welcomes!”</p>

<p>“Welcomes, is it?” quoth Sir Hector, reining
nearer and shaking dust from every fold of his riding-cloak.
“Welcomes whateffer—an’ me nigh choked
wi’ your dust, and ye’sel’ up tae a’ manner o’ deevilish
ploys and riots—an’ wounded gentlemen cursin’ theirsel’s
intae fevers all along the road, and a’ on your
account, Master John Derwent!”</p>

<p>“Nay, merely one gentleman—of sorts, Hector!
I had the fortune to meet with my Lord Sayle, who
was somewhat ill-mannered——”</p>

<p>“Aye, but didna ye tak’ the man’s post-horses?”</p>

<p>“I perceive you ha’ heard something of the matter,
Hector.”</p>

<p>“I hae that ... and o’ the lass, forbye! O
John, John, is she wi’ ye yet?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Hector, safe and sound!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“O man, are ye rin clean daft?”</p>

<p>“Never saner, Hector.”</p>

<p>“A common, country serving-wench, puir lass....
O man John!”</p>

<p>“Nay, Hector, the most uncommon serving-wench
that ever served since serving was or wenches were!”</p>

<p>“Hoot-toot—dinna palter wi’ worrds, John! Think
o’ y’r reputation!”</p>

<p>“Nay, faith,” sighed Sir John; “’tis so devilish
blown upon, so warped and weatherbeaten, that I had
fain forget it. And as for my Rose——”</p>

<p>“Oh, shame, John, for shame!” exclaimed Sir
Hector, falling into his precise English. “I had
hoped you had left such wickedness behind in Paris
with your scandalous marquises and such.”</p>

<p>“Why, there it is, Hector; my Rose is such vast
and welcome change to your fine ladies, for instead
o’ languishing, sinking or swooning with mock-modesty
as your great lady should, she talks to me of—her
grandmother! She is immaculate, Hector, Innocence
incarnate—and I find her vastly edifying. And, egad,
I’ve kissed her but once, and that upon the brow—in
all these miles! Come—how d’ye say to that?”</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” exclaimed Sir Hector.</p>

<p>“Pray,” questioned Sir John, “pray what might
you mean exactly, Hector?”</p>

<p>“That I’m no minded tae sit here choked wi’ dust
hearkenin’ tae sermons on ye’ ain virtues.... An’
high tide at twa o’clock! Push on, man, push on,
and ye s’all be in Sussex to-morrow’s morn.”</p>

<p>“In heaven’s name, how?”</p>

<p>“Whisht, lad! I happen to know of a boat—juist
a wee bit fishin’-boat, y’ ken—as sails the nicht.”</p>

<p>“’Tis marvellous what you ‘happen’ to know.
Hector!”</p>

<p>“Tush, man! Are ye for Sussex an’ Cuckmere
Haven to-morrow morn?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart.”</p>

<p>“Then ‘hurry’s’ the word, John.”</p>

<span class="smaller">DESCRIBES THE ADVENTURES OF THE <i>TRUE BELIEVER</i></span></h2>

</div>

<p>One o’clock was striking as they rumbled into the
ancient town of Dieppe and pulled up before
the posting-inn. Here Sir John, having paid and feed
his driver, was for ordering supper, but Sir Hector
would have none of it.</p>

<p>“Come awa’, Johnnie,” he insisted, “an’ if ye’re
hungry, I’ll find ye a red herring—mebbe a couple.
Come awa’!”</p>

<p>“A herring? How say you, Rose child?” questioned
Sir John, but my lady not troubling to answer,
he tucked her hand within his arm and bade Sir Hector
lead on.</p>

<p>“Ha—but the girl, John—ye’ll no’ be for
draggin’ the puir lassie awa’ wi’ ye tae sea—at
midnight?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Hector; if she will not walk I must
carry her. Howbeit, she comes to share my
herring!”</p>

<p>“O John!” sighed Sir Hector; “O Johnnie man,
I’m fair amazed at ye!” And shaking gloomy head
he turned and strode on before.</p>

<p>Once out of the dim-lit innyard, darkness engulfed
them, but Sir Hector strode unhesitatingly; along
narrow streets he led them, beneath the grim shadow
of frowning archways and buildings, through a maze
of winding alleys and ill-paved byways, turning
sudden corners until, all at once, they were treading
firm sand and there met them a wind fresh and sweet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
with the salt tang of the sea. Presently before them,
vague in the gloom, was a small bay or inlet with a
jetty, and beyond this the dim bulk of a ship, a very
silent craft with never a glimmer of light from stem to
stern.</p>

<p>“John, bide ye here!” said Sir Hector softly, and
strode forward, to vanish in the dark; then rose a
sweet, flute-like whistle rendering the first bars of
“Blue Bonnets over the Border,” which was answered,
after a little, by a hoarse voice in English:</p>

<p>“Be that your honour?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, Sharkie man, wi’ twa friends. Send
the boat!”</p>

<p>“Nay, I be comin’ myself, sir!”</p>

<p>Followed a scrambling, scuffling sound, the dip of
oars, creak of rowlocks and a mutter of voices, then
Sir Hector called softly:</p>

<p>“This way, John.”</p>

<p>With his companion’s hand in his, Sir John advanced
cautiously until, above the stones of the jetty, at his
very feet, he visioned the dim outline of a human head
that admonished him thus:</p>

<p>“Gi’e’s a holt o’ the young ’ooman, sir, an’ easy it
is!”</p>

<p>Here my lady manifested very decided unwillingness
to be taken a “holt of”, but was swung suddenly
aloft in compelling arms, passed below to other arms
and safely deposited in the stern-sheets of a swaying
boat; then the others followed in turn, and they
pushed off. Half a dozen strokes brought them to the
side of a fair-sized vessel, and very soon my lady found
herself set on deck, her hand securely tucked within
Sir John’s arm.</p>

<p>“Perfect!” he exclaimed, glancing aloft at dim-seen,
raking masts. “But wherefore all this stealth
and secrecy, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Whisht, man! Wha’ gars ye tae say sic things o’
honest fusher-folk? Ye’re aboard the <i>True Believer</i>,
Johnnie lad, juist a bit fushin’-boat out o’ Newhaven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>“She’s something large and heavily sparred for a
fishing-boat, isn’t she, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Gude sakes, John, and wha’ d’ye ken o’ fushin’-boats
whateffer?”</p>

<p>“The <i>True Believer</i>? ’Tis a strange name!”</p>

<p>“’Tis a graund, godly name, John, an’ she’s
owned by a godly man, a man as sings bass in
the church choir, a worthy fushin’-body, as I ken
fine. Dinna fash ye’self, John lad; wi’ luck an’ a
favourin’ wind we should be ashore a little after
dawn.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, this fishing-boat doth not fish to-night,
Hector?”</p>

<p>“I’m no’ tellin’ ye she will.”</p>

<p>“But, Hector, if a fishing-boat fisheth not then
fishing-boat she cannot be except she fish for other
than fish, and yet, so fishing, she fisheth not truly, and
truly can be no true fishing-boat——” But finding
Sir Hector had vanished, he drew his companion
into a corner well screened from the wind, and here,
despite the dark, contrived a seat with canvas and a
coil of rope.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said he, as they sat side by side, “it seems
that some time to-morrow we shall have reached our
journey’s end and must say good-bye. Shall you
miss me, child ... grieve a little?”</p>

<p>For a moment she was silent, and when she answered
her tone was primly demure.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir, and indeed I shall, for your honour’s
been mortal kind, I’m sure!”</p>

<p>“Ha’ done with your play-acting, girl!” said he
so sharply that she started and would have risen, but
his grip on her arm restrained her.</p>

<p>“Play-acting?” she repeated in altered voice.
“How, sir? D’ye think——”</p>

<p>“’Tis no matter, child,” he answered lightly;
“my thoughts are my own. But for a little space I
would have you your best, most worthy self. To-morrow
we part and may meet again but rarely ...<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
if ever. Shall you bear in your mind a kindly memory
of me, Rose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered gravely.</p>

<p>“When you shall hear wild tales of the ‘Wicked
Dering,’ will you think of him as ... as he is now
... a man perchance a little better than he is
painted?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered again, conscious of his dejected
attitude though she saw his face but a pale blur in
the gloom. “And will your honour be returning to
Paris?”</p>

<p>“No, child.”</p>

<p>“To London?”</p>

<p>“Nor London. I intend to live in the country for
awhile.”</p>

<p>“Then why can’t your honour see me now an’
then?” Here she was aware that he had lifted his
head and turned to peer at her.</p>

<p>“I shall be very ... busy,” he answered, with a
strange pause between the two words.</p>

<p>“And will your honour have time to miss me?”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows it, child!” he answered, leaning
nearer.</p>

<p>“And shall you be—always busy, sir?” she questioned
softly, swaying towards him until, despite the
darkness, he could behold all the witchery of her look.
“Shall you think of me sometimes?”</p>

<p>“Often, Rose ... as the most wonderful ... of—serving-maids!”
he answered, turning suddenly

<p>“How wonderful?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Vastly wonderful, child.”</p>

<p>“What d’you mean by wonderful?”</p>

<p>“Just—wonderful; you fill me with wonder.”</p>

<p>“What of, pray?”</p>

<p>“Yourself.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Heavens, child! Just because you are a woman
and possess a mind feminine, which is the wonder of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
wonders since ’tis beyond the understanding of man
or woman. As saith the song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘The mind of a woman can never be known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You never can tell it aright.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall I tell you the reason?—She knows not her own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It changes so often ere night.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twould puzzle Apollo</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And there y’have it, child!”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed, sir! But when a woman makes up
her mind to hate she can be fiercely determined as
any man——”</p>

<p>“Aye—until she remembers she’s a woman!”</p>

<p>“And what then, sir?”</p>

<p>“Then, child, she becometh truly dangerous!” he
answered. “Now here’s you, my Rose, a sweet,
simple, country maid that talks like Aspasia, Sophonisba,
Pallas Athene and the Three Wise Women of
Hunsdon—or Hogsden, or whatever it was—all rolled
into one. Yet, child, thou couldst never truly hate,
thine eyes are too gentle, thy lips too tenderly full,
thyself too generously formed——”</p>

<p>“Meaning ‘buxom,’ I s’pose?”</p>

<p>“Juno-like, let us say.”</p>

<p>“Pray, sir,” she inquired, after another pause, “if
your honour marries your enemy—the great lady——”</p>

<p>“When I marry her, child!”</p>

<p>“When your honour marries her—if she doth not
wed another—will your honour still think of poor
Rose?”</p>

<p>“My honour will, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Then ’twill be wicked and dishonourable in your
honour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>“But very natural! For indeed I think my honour
might learn to love thee, child, could we but find thee
a soul.”</p>

<p>“Love?” she repeated a little scornfully. “Could
Sir John Dering love any but Sir John Dering?”</p>

<p>“’S heart, child, your speech improves very marvellously
at times; and let me perish, Rose, but you have
an air that matches extreme ill with your homespun!”</p>

<p>“I ... I ha’n’t lived always i’ the country, sir!”
she retorted.</p>

<p>“And despite the mild innocence o’ thy look, thou
hast a temper and a tongue, Rose.”</p>

<p>“I’d be a poor, helpless creature without ’em,
sir.”</p>

<p>“As to my capacity for loving, I think I might
love as well and truly as most, aye, even to the forgetting
of John Dering. For, hid within John Dering
I am conscious of a soul, Rose, a soul so very much
greater than John Dering that ’tis great marvel John
Dering is not greater than John Dering, seeing John
Dering is the outward though very imperfect manifestation
of John Dering’s soul—a soul that will live
and love and go marching on when poor John Dering
is dust. And, look you! True love being not passion
of the flesh but virtue o’ the soul, ’tis therefore sure
that I, John Dering, shall some day love with a love
exceeding great, a love as imperishable as John Dering’s
soul. How think you, my——” Here Sir John,
chancing to lift his gaze, descried amidst the pervading
gloom a solid, round object that projected itself
immediately above him from the roof of the deck-house
behind; and, reaching up suddenly, he grasped
a shock of coarse hair.</p>

<p>“Aha!” he exclaimed, and gave the dim head
a shake; whereupon came a groping hand to rend
and smite, a hand that shrank and vanished at the
threatening click of Sir John’s ready pistol.</p>

<p>“Who are you, rascal?” demanded Sir John.</p>

<p>“Nobody ... only me!” quavered a voice in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
hoarse, wheedling tones. “So put up your wepping,
sir!”</p>

<p>“What are you after?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’, sir ... only a-layin’ by till all ’ands
is turned up. So don’t go shooting of a innocent
wictim, sir.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean by eavesdropping?”</p>

<p>“No sech thing, y’r honour ... no, never in my
life, sir. So away wi’ your wepping.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name, rogue?”</p>

<p>“Jonas, y’r honour, Jonas Skag, as honest a innocent
as ever trod plank. So if y’r honour will put up y’r
wepping and leggo my ’air kindly, I’ll be obleeged to
your honour ’umbly.”</p>

<p>Sir John loosed the wheedling Jonas with a final
shake, uncocked and re-pocketed his pistol, and looked
round to find his companion had risen.</p>

<p>“The rogue disturbed us,” he sighed, “which is
pity, for I was but warming to my theme. When I
am upon the soul, and especially my own, I grow well-nigh
lyrical. Let us sit down again and continue.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I’m a-cold!” she answered, drawing her
cloak. “Hark! I think theym getting ready to sail.”</p>

<p>All about them was a hushed stir, a murmurous
whispering, a thud of quick, soft feet, a flitting to and
fro of dim forms, the faint sound of well-greased
blocks and rousing-gear, the scarce-heard rattle of a
chain, as the great yards rose slowly into the gloom
above, and the anchor was hove.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Sir John, “we are stealing away
to sea, and never surely was it quieter done! Come,
let us go forward and watch!”</p>

<p>Now it chanced that as they went she tripped suddenly,
fell against him, and then he had her in his arms.
Passive she lay in his clasp, her face upturned to his,
and, dark though it was, he saw the lure of those
parted lips so near his own, the down-sweeping lashes,
felt all the urge and coquetry of her.</p>

<p>“O Rose of love!” he murmured. “Were I any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
other than John Dering and thou any other than—thyself!
O Innocence!” And uttering a strange,
harsh laugh, he set her upon her feet. “Stand up,
Rose, stand up!” he commanded. “And a heaven’s
name be more wary o’ thy going. Come!” But she
neither stirred nor spoke. “I might have kissed thee
and—did not!” said he. “And for this, being very
woman, thou’rt like to hate me more than ever. Is’t
not so?”</p>

<p>But, giving utterance to an inarticulate exclamation,
she turned swiftly and left him.</p>

<p>As he stood looking after her, he was presently aware
of a gigantic form looming beside him.</p>

<p>“Aha!” sighed he, slipping his hand within Sir
Hector’s arm. “Pray now resolve me this riddle,
friend, namely and to wit: Why doth this ‘True-believing’
fishing-boat steal forth so silently a-fishing?
Is it, think ye, that she may surprise the fish and take
’em in their sleep?”</p>

<p>“Havers, Johnnie man, dinna fash me wi’ sic
fule questions,” answered Sir Hector. “B’my soul,
I believe yo’ve fush on y’r brain, whateffer!”</p>

<p>“Mayhap, Hector, but I’ve one or two other things
as well,” sighed Sir John, drawing his cloak against
the freshening breeze.</p>

<span class="smaller">FURTHER CONCERNING THE SAME</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“Yonder breaks the dawn, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Aye, lad, and ’tis an unco’ inspirin’ sicht
tae watch the sun rise abune this weary waste o’
waters like the speerit o’ life. ’Tis mony a sunrise
I’ve watched syne I was a wee bit laddie ... an’
’tis nae wonder ’twas worshipped by the ancients as
a god.... See, yonder he comes, a flamin’ majesty!
Could ony human mind conceive anything sae glorious,
sae deevine, sae—— Ten thousand deevils! Look
yonder! Ahoy, Sharkie—Sharkie man!”</p>

<p>Glancing whither Sir Hector’s long finger pointed,
Sir John espied the top-gallant sails of a ship uprearing
from the mists of dawn, topsails of radiant glory flushing
from scarlet to pink, from pink to saffron, and so
at last to shining gold. Slowly the vessel herself came
into view, her high, clean bow, the line of her grinning
gun-ports.</p>

<p>Suddenly from her fore-chase gushed roaring flame,
and round shot hissed athwart the lugger’s forefoot.</p>

<p>And now upon the <i>True Believer’s</i> deck was a scurring
of men, silent no longer—men who cursed and
laughed, shouting and pointing, yet never in each
other’s way, taking their appointed stations like the
true sailor-men they were, and who stared, one and
all, from their pursuer to the brown-faced, serene man
who neither shouted nor pointed, but stood with Sir
Hector, gazing at the oncoming brig in dispassionate
judgment of her pace—and all voices were hushed
awaiting his command. When at last he spoke, his word
was obeyed on the jump; reefs were loosed, shaken out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
and hauled taut, lee-stays eased, and the <i>True Believer</i>,
heeling to the wind, drove hissing upon her course at
increased speed.</p>

<p>“What ship’s yon, Sharkie man?” inquired Sir
Hector of the imperturbable man beside him.</p>

<p>“’Tis the <i>Seahorse</i> brig, y’r honour ... ten guns
out o’ Ryde.... Must ha’ been layin’ hove-to hereabouts
in the mist ... waitin’ for us, which is strange
... strange! But there aren’t a craft anywheres
along the coast can forereach the <i>True Believer</i> on a
wind—aye, or goin’ free, much less yon lubberly
brig!” quoth the placid Sharkie, balancing himself
serenely upon the sloping deck.</p>

<p>“John!” cried Sir Hector, clutching a weather-brace
in one hand and flourishing the other towards
the speaker. “This is ma frien’, Sharkie Nye, a man
o’ sound judgment except i’ the doctrine o’ Predestination!
Sharkie man, this is Sir—umph!—John Derwent,
wha I ha’ kenned from his cradle, and moreover,
Sharkie—— Losh, man—yon was nearish!” he
exclaimed as a round-shot hummed between their
raking masts.</p>

<p>“Aye, y’r honour, though I’ve ’ad ’em nearer afore
now!” nodded Mr. Nye; “but we’ll be out o’ reach
in a bit if none o’ our gear is carried away or——”
A rending crash, a whirr of flying splinters and a gaping
rent appeared in the <i>True Believer’s</i> bulwarks forward.</p>

<p>“That,” quoth Mr. Nye, viewing the damage with
calculating eye, “that were a bit nearer, sir. Forward
there!” he roared suddenly. “Any on ye hurt?”</p>

<p>“Nary a soul, Sharkie!” a cheery voice roared
back; “us du be layin’ low-like!”</p>

<p>“The brig be gettin’ ’er range on us,” continued
Mr. Nye, “which may mak’ it a bit ark’ard for a minute
or two, ’specially for the young ’ooman—best take ’er
below, sirs.” And away he lurched for a word with the
steersman, while Sir John made his way to her who
clung, staring wide-eyed at their oncoming, relentless
pursuer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>“Rose,” said he, “I will see you below!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” she answered, “you will no such thing!”</p>

<p>“There is danger on deck here!”</p>

<p>“So is there below.”</p>

<p>“Will you obey me?”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“Then I shall carry you.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall kick!”</p>

<p>“Egad!” he exclaimed; “I believe you would!”</p>

<p>“I’ faith, sir,” she nodded, “I vow I should!”</p>

<p>Here, meeting each other’s glance, they laughed;
then he was beside her and had caught her hand.</p>

<p>“Rose child, if I begged you to leave the deck——”</p>

<p>“’Twould be of none avail!” she answered, her
eyes very bright. “This is life!”</p>

<p>“And in the midst of life we are in death!” he
retorted.</p>

<p>“Then if death come I prefer to die here in the sun
and wind.”</p>

<p>“Ha’ you no fear, child?”</p>

<p>“Not of death!”</p>

<p>“Of what, then?”</p>

<p>“Of myself!” she answered, turning to glance at
their pursuer again.</p>

<p>“Why of yourself?” But ere she could reply he
had leapt and dragged her beneath him to the deck
as the guns roared again, followed by a clamour of
shouts and cries forward, a confusion of dismayed
shouting and a great flapping of rent canvas as the
<i>True Believer</i>, swinging up into the wind, lay a fair
target for the Preventive brig’s gunnery. A shot furrowed
her deck abaft the mainmast, another crashed
through her bulwarks aft and, struck by a flying splinter,
Sir Hector staggered and brought up against the lee-rail
grasping at torn and bloody sleeve.</p>

<p>“Dinna fash ye’sel’, John lad!” he panted, as Sir
John leapt to him. “Toots, man, let be! ’Tis nae
mair than a wee scratch—though painfu’ forbye.
But wha’s come tae a’ the lads? Sharkie!” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
roared; “Sharkie man, ye’ll no’ strike tae the de’ils
yonder?”</p>

<p>“Not me, y’r honour,” answered Mr. Nye, signalling
to the steersman; “leastways, not while I’ve a sail as
will draw——”</p>

<p>“An’ will ye let ’em shoot ye tae pieces an’ gi’e
’em nothing in return? O man, hae ye no arteelery?”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir, a tidy piece under the tarpaulin yonder.
But Lord love ’ee, sir, to fire agin a King’s ship is
treason, piracy, murder, Execution Dock and damnation——”</p>

<p>“What o’ that, Sharkie? Wull ye look at me
arrm?”</p>

<p>“I’ll whip my neckerchief round it, y’r honour——”</p>

<p>“Ye’ll no sic thing till I’ve tried a shot at yon
deevils. Haul ye gun aft, Sharkie; I was an arteelery
officer, y’ ken——”</p>

<p>“No, no, y’r honour; we’ll be on our course again
so soon as we’ve rove new running-gear and——”</p>

<p>“Hoot, Sharkie—wull ye look at my arrm? An’
see yonder, they’re comin’ up wi’ us fast ... their
next broadside should sink us. Aft wi’ the gun,
Sharkie, and I’ll dae me best tae haud ’em off a
while.”</p>

<p>For a long moment Mr. Nye studied the oncoming
brig, chewing placidly at his quid of tobacco; finally
he nodded, albeit unwillingly, whereupon eager hands
hasted to uncover, load and haul the gun aft; and
there, grovelling upon his knees, spattering blood all
round him, Sir Hector trained and sighted the long,
deadly piece.</p>

<p>“A smoothish sea, Sharkie!” he muttered. “’Tis
a fair shot ... if my hand has no’ lost its cunning ...
so and so ... a thocht mair eleevation!”</p>

<p>“And now, when you’m ready, sir,” said Mr. Nye,
blowing upon the fuse he had lighted, “if you’ll stand
away I’ll give fire——”</p>

<p>“You!” exclaimed Sir Hector fiercely. “You,
Sharkie? Man, d’ye ken I’m Hector Lauchlan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
MacLean o’ Duart? Gi’e’s the match afore I heave
ye tae the fushes!” So saying, he snatched the fuse,
blew on it, glanced along the piece and gave fire.
Smoke, flame, a roar that seemed to shake the <i>True
Believer</i> from stem to stern, and then, as the smoke
cleared, every man aboard cheered lustily and long
as the brig’s fore-topmast was seen to sway, totter
and plunge over to leeward in flapping ruin.</p>

<p>“O John!” exclaimed Sir Hector, staggering to the
rail. “O Johnnie, am I no’ ... juist a ... bonny
gunner!” And then Sir John, with Sharkie Nye, ran
to catch him as he fell.</p>

<p>They carried him below, and there, having bared the
gash in mighty forearm, they set about such rough
surgery as they might; but to them, swift footed and
authoritative, came one who took over the ugly
business—one with hands far quicker and more capable
than their own, and who, finding all things to her
purpose, bade them begone.</p>

<p>Reaching the deck, they saw the <i>Seahorse</i> brig,
hampered by her wrecked topmast, had brought to;
and though her guns still flashed and roared, their shot
did no more harm, for the <i>True Believer</i>, her damage
repaired, was foaming upon her way once more.</p>

<p>“Ecod, sir,” murmured Mr. Nye, rubbing at bristly
chin, “but for that shot ... ’twas touch an’ go wi’
us for a minute, d’ye see! That shot ... was ...
a shot! Aye, a shot as’ll be ’eer’d and talked on all
along the coast ... ’tis for us <i>True Believers</i>—all
on us—to keep tight mouths or some on us may swing.
That young ’ooman now ... I be a cautious man
by natur’, sir, so what o’ the young ’ooman? Females
talk, d’ye see!”</p>

<p>“I can promise you that she will not,” answered
Sir John, stretching wearied limbs in the grateful
sunshine. “You need be under no apprehension on
her account.”</p>

<p>“And to be sure she’ve a proper masterful, damn-your-eyes
way wi’ her, drown’d me if she ain’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>“Very true, Mr. Nye; you may ha’ noticed she has
a chin!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir ... but so ’ave I.”</p>

<p>“Very bristly—like mine own, Mr. Nye, while hers
is dimpled yet determined.”</p>

<p>“And her carries it like any grand lady!”</p>

<p>“Exactly what I have thought, Mr. Nye!”</p>

<p>“Though I don’t set much store by fe-males, sir,
being a bachelor, very determinated, d’ye see!”</p>

<p>“My own case precisely!” murmured Sir John.
Then, with one accord, they turned to glance back at
the <i>Seahorse</i> brig, now fast disappearing in the haze
of a hot, midsummer morning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">OF AN ALTRUISTIC SCOT</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Despite her wounds, the <i>True Believer</i> made a
fair crossing, and the day was still young when
Sir John, stumbling up from the dark and noisome
hole Mr. Nye called his “state-room,” drank deep
of the sweet morning air and hasted to the rail, there
to lean and gaze ecstatic upon the Sussex shore. A
coast of fair, green slopes, of snowy cliffs, just now all
pink and gold in the early sunshine, with, above and
beyond, the blue swell of the Downs. A coast that
has known much of storm and battle since Roman
armour flashed beneath the resistless eagles, and
William the Norman landed on Pevensey Level to
march his eager mercenaries against the war-worn
ranks of Saxon Harold.</p>

<p>And yet it is a gentle coast of white and green and
purple distances, its every rock and headland seeming
to beckon the weary, home-returning traveller, speaking
to him of remembered hamlets nestling amid the
green; of familiar roads, tree-shaded, a-wind between
flowery banks and hedgerows; of quiet villages and
sleepy, ancient towns backed by the swelling grandeur
of the silent, mysterious Downs.</p>

<p>The peep of clustered homesteads drowsing in
sheltered cove, the majesty of towering white cliffs
soaring from boulder-strewn, foam-washed foreshore;
the wide beaches backed by the grey spires and towers
of some town—these are “home,” and their mere
sight like the welcoming grip of some friendly hand.</p>

<p>Thus stood Sir John, scanning remembered hamlet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
and village glad-eyed: Shoreham and Brighthelmstone,
Rottingdean, Newhaven and Seaford, the snowy
cliffs of Cuckmere Bay, with the dim shape of mighty
Beachy Head afar.</p>

<p>So lost was he in memories conjured up of these
well-remembered, boyish haunts that he started to
feel a hand upon his shoulder, and turned to find Sir
Hector beside him; he bore a neatly bandaged arm in
a sling beneath his coat and was smoking the short,
clay pipe he affected.</p>

<p>“How are you now, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Gey an’ bonny, thanks tae yon Rose. Faith.
John, she’s by ordinar’, I’m thinkin’!”</p>

<p>“My own idea exactly, Hector——”</p>

<p>“An’ the hand o’ her, John!”</p>

<p>“Ah, so you have noticed them also, Hector? So
white and shapely ... and pretty——”</p>

<p>“Pretty? Hoot awa’, ’tis their gentleness, their
quickness——”</p>

<p>“Such slender fingers, Hector, such pink palms——”</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” snorted Sir Hector, and turned
to stare landwards. “A fair prospect, John lad!”
quoth he suddenly in his precise English. “’Tis
better than your perfumed salons in Paris, or the
gilded pomp and pageantry of Versailles. Aye, a
sweet and homely prospect—though, mind ye, ’tis no’
tae be compared wi’ Scotland, whateffer.”</p>

<p>“Why did you leave Scotland, Hector? And how
come you, of all men, to be friends with Mr. Nye and
his fellow-smugglers?”</p>

<p>“Egad, ’tis a long story, John! But, briefly, you
must know that chancing to have the better o’ my
good cousin Lauchlan—‘the MacLean’—(o’er a point
o’ strategy, if I mind rightly), I left the MacLean
country and the hame o’ my forefaythers, though my
heart was sair waefu’, John, an’ became a roofless
wight—a hameless wanderer!”</p>

<p>“And all by reason of a quarrel with your cousin,
Hector?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, juist that! Ye see, Johnnie, it so happened
the man was like tae dee!”</p>

<p>“To die, Hector? How so?”</p>

<p>“Why, the puir gentleman misjudged his distance,
and my Andrew here took him a ding i’ the wame,
Johnnie.”</p>

<p>“Aha, a duel, was it? When was this, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Twa-three years aboot, lad. So, bein’ a lone man
and weary wi’ my wandering, y’ ken, I minded you,
Johnnie, an’ cam’ Sussex-wards a-seekin’ ye. But,
learnin’ ye were leevin’ in Parus an’ much too fine a
gentleman for Sussex, I bought me a wee bit hoosie
ower Alfriston way—an’ there I’m leevin’ yet, God
be thankit.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, Hector, since I intend living at High
Dering henceforth, you must live there too. You
shall have your old rooms in the north wing ... your
study, Hector, with so few books and so very many
weapons ... ’twas there you gave me my first lesson
in fencing. Do you remember?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I do, lad. And you were ower fond o’ the
‘point’ even then, John. But as for comin’ back
yonder to live—whisht, laddie! Alfriston suits me
fine, an’ ma bit hoosie is nane sae bad for a lonely
man, y’ ken!”</p>

<p>“Tush!” exclaimed Sir John, a trifle pettishly.
“High Dering won’t seem home without you. And
if you are so lonely——”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m no’ juist solitary, John lad. I hae my
company for a crack now an’ then and to smoke a
pipe wi’ of an evening; there’s Geordie Potter an’
Peter Bunkle, an’ Joe Pursglove an’ Joe Muddle,
an’ ane or two mair. So y’ see I’m no’ juist solitary.”</p>

<p>“But you live alone, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I dae that—leastways, there’s Wully
Tamson sleeps i’ my kitchen on account o’ his wife
when he’s fu’—which is frequent.... But, Johnnie”—here
Sir Hector paused to stare very hard at his short
clay pipe—“I’ve lately had an idea—very lately!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
I’ve juist the noo come tae a fixed determination....
’Tis like enough I shall be a lonely man nae longer,
y’ ken.”</p>

<p>“’S death, Hector man, you never think of
marrying?”</p>

<p>“Marryin’—me? Losh, man, dae I look like it?
Dinna be sic a fule! I’m fair amazed at ye! No,
John,” continued Sir Hector, his English suddenly
precise, “I have, upon due consideration, determined
to adopt the girl Rose——”</p>

<p>“Aha!” exclaimed Sir John, with sudden laugh,
but meeting Sir Hector’s glare of angered amazement,
contrived to regain his gravity. “So you have determined
to ... to adopt my Rose child, have you,
Hector?”</p>

<p>“I hae that!”</p>

<p>“Have you put the matter to her?”</p>

<p>“I hae so!”</p>

<p>“And what said she?”</p>

<p>“The puir, preety soul fair turned her back an’
weepit, John.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” exclaimed Sir John again. “Hum!
Wept, did she, Hector?”</p>

<p>“She did that!”</p>

<p>“And you saw her tears down-distilling all crystalline
woe, Hector?”</p>

<p>“She had her back tae me, I’m tellin’ ye!”</p>

<p>“Well, did she embrace your offer in humble,
grateful thankfulness?”</p>

<p>“She’s tae gi’e me her answer when she’s conseedered
the matter.”</p>

<p>“So, Hector, you offer her the comfort and shelter
of a home, the secure protection of your care ...
merely because she tended the hurt in your arm?”</p>

<p>Sir Hector seemed to find some difficulty with the
drawing of his pipe; he examined it, tapped it, grew
red in the face blowing down it, and finally, giving it
up in despair, spoke.</p>

<p>“John, ye’ve a shrewd eye for a bonny lass. I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
no’ deny she’s an unco’ handsome creature. But,
wha’s better, lad, she’s a gude lass, sweet an’ pure,
John ... and here’s mysel’, an auld sojer as kens
little o’ women except—t’other sort; here’s me, John,
wad keep her gude and pure as she is. Gin she’ll but
trust tae my care, here’s me will shield her from
onything and onybody, aye, even from—from——”</p>

<p>“Me, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Aye—juist yersel’, John.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” sighed Sir John, and turned to stare at the
shore again, its sandy bays and snowy cliffs much
nearer now, while Sir Hector, eyeing him a little askance,
began to worry at his pipe again. And then she
who was the subject of their talk stepped out upon deck
and stood gazing shorewards beneath her hand.</p>

<p>“You are quite sure, then, that I mean her evil?”
inquired Sir John softly, his glance upon her unconscious
form.</p>

<p>“Why, Jock ... why, Jock lad, ... ye see ...
there’s y’r reputation!”</p>

<p>“My reputation!” he repeated. “Ever and always
my reputation. Aye, to be sure, Hector, to be sure—my
reputation dogs me and will do all my days....
I am no fit companion for Innocence; my reputation
forbids.... It goes beside me like a shadow, and yet
for the moment I had forgot it. Rose!” he called
suddenly. “Rose child, pray come hither!” Mutely
obedient she came and stood, glancing quick-eyed from
one to the other. “Rose,” he continued, “my old
and most honoured friend, Sir Hector MacLean, tells me
he hath offered you the shelter of a father’s care?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour.”</p>

<p>“I have known and loved Sir Hector from my earliest
years, and tell you that in him you would find the most
honourable, kindest, most generous friend and guardian
in all this big world——”</p>

<p>“Hoot, John lad!” exclaimed Sir Hector. “Ha’
done; ye fair mak’ me blush!” And away he strode,
incontinent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“Knowing you as I do, child,” continued Sir John,
his keen gaze upon her down-bent face, “I fear that
Sir Hector’s so altruistic offer may seem to you a
matter for laughter——”</p>

<p>“Laughter?” she repeated in hot anger. “Oh,
indeed, sir! Be this another o’ your honour’s clever
guesses?”</p>

<p>“And so, Rose,” he went on placidly, “if you must
laugh indeed, laugh behind his back; do not let him
see, for ’twould wound him deeply——”</p>

<p>“And d’ye think I don’t know it!” she exclaimed
furiously. “Do you think I don’t see in him all that
is lacking in yourself, Sir John Dering? Simplicity,
unselfishness, a noble innocence—the child in the man,
thinking no evil. And think you I shall laugh at such?
Oh, by heaven, I scorn you for so thinking——”</p>

<p>“And by heaven, child, you swear as trippingly as
any fine lady——”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, my mistress is a pretty swearer, I’ve
heard say!”</p>

<p>“Howbeit, Rose, when you shall refuse Sir Hector’s
generous and most ridiculous offer, as you surely
will——”</p>

<p>“Oh, shall I, sir?”</p>

<p>“Beyond doubt!”</p>

<p>“You are sure, sir?”</p>

<p>“Positive!”</p>

<p>“And pray why is your honour so very certain?”</p>

<p>“Because you could never mother an old man in
a cottage—or any other man, for that matter. The
Spirit of Motherliness which is the true glory of woman
is not within you, Rose, or ... perchance it
sleepeth. Who can imagine you bringing a man his
slippers, lighting his pipe, scheming out and cooking
some dish for the joy of seeing him eat, making his
comfort your happiness? Not I! For these are but
everyday, small duties—very humble things in themselves
which yet, in the sum, make up that divine
Spirit of Motherhood, that self-sacrificing, patient,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
unwearying, humble service that lifteth woman very
nigh the angels.”</p>

<p>“Faith, sir,” she exclaimed contemptuously, “you
talk finer than any parson and sound more sanctimonious
than any good book that ever sent me to
sleep! And remembering your honour’s reputation,
what d’you know of angels, pray?”</p>

<p>“Naught i’ the world, child! Yet even I have my
dreams. Now as to yourself——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all body an’ no soul!” she exclaimed
bitterly.</p>

<p>“You have a fine, shapely body, girl——”</p>

<p>“Oh, your honour flatters me!”</p>

<p>“But your soul, Rose, your soul is—let us say
asleep, and its place usurped by a wild spirit a-tiptoe
for adventure, heedless of restraint, passionate, unreasoning
and apt to plunge you into all manner o’
follies and dangers——”</p>

<p>“And doth all this go to prove I shall refuse Sir
Hector’s kind offer?”</p>

<p>“And when you do, child, let your refusal be gentle;
put on for him your tenderest air, act for him your
sweetest, most innocent self——”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank’ee kindly, Sir John Dering, your
honour!” she broke out fiercely. “But when I give
him my answer I shall speak, and act, and think, and
look exactly how I please!”</p>

<p>He was regarding my lady’s retreating back somewhat
wistfully when Sir Hector joined him.</p>

<p>“What hae ye done t’ offend th’ lassie, John?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“I have been making up her mind to accept your
offer, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Eh—eh? You have, ye say, John—you?”</p>

<p>“Myself, Hector! And yet, have I done right to
influence the child, I wonder? Are you sufficiently
old and reverend with years to become the guardian
of a young and handsome girl?”</p>

<p>“Old enough!” exclaimed Sir Hector indignantly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
“Losh, man, am I no’ a person full o’ years ... aye,
and an elder o’ the kirk, forbye? Am I no’ a puir
auld sojer-man wi’ ane fut i’ the grave? Am I no’?”</p>

<p>“Faith and indeed, Hector, you are the youngest
old man in Christendom.”</p>

<p>“John, juist what are ye suggestin’?”</p>

<p>“Well, among other things, that you be duly prepared
to eat more than is good for you, to have your
slippers brought to you o’ nights, your pipe lighted,
and, in fine, to be mothered morning, noon and
night.”</p>

<p>“Whisht, Johnnie man, ye’re talkin’ wild-like, I’m
thinkin’, and——”</p>

<p>“Axing y’r pardons, honours both,” said Captain
Sharkie Nye, stepping forward at this juncture to
knuckle a bristly eyebrow at each in turn and jerk
a thumb shorewards, “but yonder lays Noohaven,
an’ the ‘Anchor’ be a fair, good inn. Y’ see, sirs,
George Potter ain’t signalled us, which do mean as
us must stand off an’ on till it be dark. So if it be
arl the same to ye, sirs, we’ll set ye ashore so soon
as you be ready.”</p>

<p>Sir Hector assenting forthwith, the boat was got
alongside, and they prepared to descend.</p>

<p>“Lord love us, Sir ’Ector, your honour!” exclaimed
Captain Nye as they shook hands, “’twas a woundy
good shot o’ yourn, a shot as will be minded an’
talked on fur many a day, aye—long arter we be dry
bones, I reckon. ’Tidn’t often a King’s ship be
’andled so rough, an’ ’tis for arl on us to keep tight
mouths, I reckon. I’ll be into Alfriston one o’ these
nights in the dark o’ the moon to smoke a pipe wi’
your honour, ’cording to custom.”</p>

<p>And so, having got into the pitching boat with no
small difficulty, they were rowed ashore (discreetly
outside the harbour), and were soon tramping up the
slope of pebbly beach, beyond which lay the town.
Presently they paused, as by mutual consent, and
glanced back to see the boat hauled aboard the lugger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
whose sails were smartly trimmed, and away foamed
the <i>True Believer</i> seawards, with Captain Sharkie Nye
waving his red cap to them from her rail.</p>

<p>“And now,” sighed Sir John, “as regards that
promised herring——”</p>

<p>“Herring!” snorted Sir Hector. “My puir lass—are
ye no’ hungry—famishing?”</p>

<p>“Too hungry to tell, sir!” she answered.</p>

<p>“After all, Hector,” quoth Sir John, “though
undoubtedly nourishing, perhaps a herring is not——”</p>

<p>“Tae the de’il wi’ y’r herrin’, man! Tam Levitt
at the ‘Anchor’ yonder hath ay a ham tae cut at, wi’
a prime roast o’ beef ... by Andrew, the thocht nigh
unmans me! Gi’e’s y’r hand, Rose, an’ let’s rin for
’t!” And off they raced forthwith, until my lady
checked and bade Sir Hector “remember his poor
arm!”</p>

<p>“And your hoary age, Hector!” added Sir John.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">DESCRIBETH THE DUPLICITY OF INNOCENCE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Mr. Thomas Levitt, the landlord, received
them beaming hearty welcome, and with
many nods and winks anent “true-believers” one and
all; and himself conducted them upstairs where, after
sundry ablutions, they sat down to viands that amply
justified Sir Hector’s prophecy. And a very excellent,
though somewhat silent, meal they made of it; even
when hunger was appeased they spoke little—Sir
Hector because he was comfortably drowsy, my lady
because she was far too busy scheming out her next
course of procedure, and Sir John because he was
content to study her half-averted face as she sat,
staring out of the open lattice. Thus he noted how
her gaze turned suddenly from the sunny landscape
without to her cloak, where it hung across an adjacent
chair-back, and thence once more to the window,
almost furtively, while her foot began to tap with
restless impatience.</p>

<p>At last, Sir Hector chancing to snore gently, my
lady started, glanced swiftly from the sleeper to Sir
John and, meeting his whimsical glance, flushed
suddenly and grew immediately angry in consequence.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” she demanded, frowning.</p>

<p>“I rejoice to know it, my Rose, for I——”</p>

<p>“I am not ‘your’ Rose!” she retorted petulantly,
whereat he smiled gently. Quoth he:</p>

<p>“Nay, Rose, who knows what the future may disclose?
Shy Rose, sly Rose, though thou seek’st to
fly, Rose——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“To fly?” she repeated, with startled look. “What—what
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“—Know, Rose, O Rose, love doth with thee go,
Rose.”</p>

<p>“Love, Sir John?” she questioned mockingly.
“Indeed, and whose? And whither doth it go,
pray?”</p>

<p>“Here and there, everywhere, this I vow to thee
and swear—‘For though thou flee, Rose, learn of me,
Rose—what is to be will surely be, Rose——’”</p>

<p>“Oh, ha’ done with your silly rhymes!” she cried
in angry impatience.</p>

<p>“O Petulance!” he sighed reproachfully. “Why
must you interrupt the prophetic muse?”</p>

<p>“Prophetic?” she exclaimed scornfully. “Is this
another o’ your marvellous guesses?”</p>

<p>“Even so, Rose. And here’s yet another! Regarding
Sir Hector, his offer, ‘to be or not to be’—your
mind is made up. Here, then, steal I away
leaving you to wake and tell him aye or no.” Saying
which, Sir John arose, tiptoed from the chamber with
elaborate care and closed the door softly behind him
before she could find a suitable retort.</p>

<p>It was perhaps some half-hour later that Sir Hector
found him busied inditing a letter; and Sir Hector’s
wig was very much askew and his eyes heavy with sleep.</p>

<p>“Whaur is she, John?” he inquired, staring about
the room. “Whaur’s the lassie Rose?”</p>

<p>“’Faith,” answered Sir John, glancing up from his
writing, “she should be safe enough. I left her with
you.”</p>

<p>“An’ me asleep! I waked but the noo an’ ne’er a
sign o’ her. Whaur is she, John?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Man, I’ve sought all o’er the inn, aye, an’ the stables
too, an’ never a glimpse o’ her——”</p>

<p>“Strange!” mused Sir John, brushing chin with
the feather of his pen. “Odd ... and yet quite
comprehensible——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“Ha, d’ye think so? Well, I ask ye whaur’s the
lass?”</p>

<p>“And I answer that I do not know.”</p>

<p>“John, is it the truth ye’re tellin’ me?” Sir John
laid down his pen and stared. “Well, can ye no’
speak? Whaur is she? What hae ye done wi’
her?”</p>

<p>“Hector,” answered Sir John softly, “I am not in
the habit of lying, nor of permitting my word to be
doubted by any man——”</p>

<p>“Aye, but I’m no’ juist ‘ony man’—I’m Hector
Lauchlan MacLean o’ Duart! Aye, an’ I mind o’er
weel y’r damnable reputation!”</p>

<p>“My reputation again—aye, to be sure!” murmured
Sir John. “My reputation discredits me still, it seems—even
with you!”</p>

<p>“An’ why for no’? I’ve seen much o’ life—plenty
evil an’ little good! I’ve kenned men honourably
born like ye’sel’ as hae lied—aye, tae their best frien’,
an’ a’ tae come at a wumman!”</p>

<p>“And you believe that I am lying?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I dae that!” cried Sir Hector in sudden
fury, clapping hand to sword.</p>

<p>Sir John rose.</p>

<p>“So you—you give me the lie?” he demanded,
grim-lipped.</p>

<p>“In y’r teeth, sir—in y’r teeth!” cried Sir Hector.
“I believe that ye’ve stolen the puir innocent lass
awa’ for y’r ain base purposes!” And now, despite
wounded arm, out flashed his ponderous blade, and
with point advanced he stepped forward fierce and
threatening; and so steel met steel. Then Sir John
let fall his sword.</p>

<p>“My father’s friend and comrade ... God forbid!”
quoth he. “Sir Hector, if you judge me rogue so
vile—strike, man, and have done!” For a long
moment Sir Hector stood irresolute, his great sword
quivering in fierce-griping hand.</p>

<p>“Ye winna fecht?” he questioned hoarsely at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>“Never with you, Hector.”</p>

<p>“An’ ye tell me ye’ve no’ hidden the lassie?”</p>

<p>“I have not!”</p>

<p>“An’ that you’ve no’ driven her awa’ wi’ y’r shameful
offers?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly not!”</p>

<p>“An’ ye’ve had naething whateffer tae dae wi’
her disappearance?”</p>

<p>“Nothing!”</p>

<p>“Then—the guid God forgi’e ye—read that, an’ ken
ye’sel’ for the false leear y’ are!” So saying, Sir
Hector slapped down an open letter on the table,
which, after a momentary hesitation, Sir John took
up; and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<i>To the nobel and generous Sir Hector.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honored Sur</span>,—The memry of your extream and
unselfish kindnes will remane ever sweet to pore me
that must leve you awhile, perchance to return. If
not arsk Sir John Dering the reason he may gess
being so clever and perchance explane all things wherefore
and why, Sir, I am your honor’s grateful</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Rose</span>.</p>

<p>“Are all wicked men so clever as wicked Sir John
Dering I wonder.”</p>

</div>

<p>“An’ now will ye fecht?” cried Sir Hector.</p>

<p>“No!” answered Sir John, flicking the letter to the
floor. “Never with you, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Why, then—I’m done wi’ ye!” roared Sir Hector,
and, turning his back, stamped from the room, closing
the door after him with a reverberating bang.</p>

<p>Left alone, Sir John reached for his sword, sheathed
it, and, picking up the letter, read it through a second
time; and conning it over thus he frowned a little,
and his chin seemed a trifle more prominent than usual.
He was standing lost in thought when, hearing a clatter
of hoofs in the yard, he glanced through the window<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
to behold Sir Hector mount and ride away, his weatherbeaten
hat cocked at a ferocious angle. Slowly and
carefully Sir John folded up the letter and thrust it
into a leathern wallet to keep company with a curl of
black and glossy hair. Then he rang and ordered a
horse in his turn.</p>

<p>“Pray, Mr. Levitt,” he inquired, “how many
posting-inns are there in this town?”</p>

<p>“Only two, sir; there be the ‘Lion’ an’ there be the
‘Wheatsheaf,’ both i’ the High Street, your honour.”</p>

<p>So in due season, the saddle-horse being at the door,
Sir John mounted, bade Mr. Levitt a cheery “good-bye”
and rode along the High Street. Inquiring at
the ‘Lion,’ he learned of an ostler the information he
sought, to wit: “That a young ’ooman—or lady—had
ordered their fastest chaise an’ druv’ away for
Lon’on ’bout a hour ago!” Sir John thanked his
informant, bestowed on him a crown and rode upon
his way, smiling a little grimly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">CONCERNING THE ADVENT OF JOHN DERWENT</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Sir John, who, it would seem, never did things
by halves, had within the week transformed that
exquisite work of art, known at Paris and Versailles
as Sir John Dering, into a very ordinary-looking Mr.
Derwent. In place of flowing peruke, embroidered
coat and perfumed silks and laces, Mr. Derwent wore
a small, unpowdered scratch-wig and a sober, snuff-coloured
suit extremely unpretentious, and instead
of gold-hilted small-sword, carried a serviceable holly-stick.
Indeed, Mr. Derwent’s whole appearance was
so eminently unnoticeable and his bearing so ordinary
that he might have been termed “insignificant,”
except perhaps for a certain tilt of his chin and the
brilliance of his long-lashed eyes.</p>

<p>It was a hot, languorous afternoon, birds chirped
drowsily, butterflies hovered, and Sir John, or rather
Mr. Derwent, seated upon the lofty summit of Firle
Beacon, breathed an air fresh from the sea yet fragrant
of the wild thyme of the Downs, and hearkened to the
larks that soared high above and all around him, filling
that same air with their joyous, trilling music: insomuch
that he grew joyous also, since this was England
and home. Beneath him the majestic Beacon swept
down to the wide vale below in great, billowing, green
curves of sweet, springy turf where a myriad flowers
bloomed; away to the south rose the mighty shape
of Windover, and between, a far-stretching vale where
homestead and hamlet nestled amid trees that bosomed
time-worn tower and ancient spire, backed by shady
copse, denser wood and the dark, far-flung forest of
Battle; a fair and wide prospect where brooks sparkled, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
winding river gleamed and white roads ran between shady
hedgerows and flowery banks; a vast expanse where the
unwearied gaze might rove from distant Lewes away to
Pevensey Level and a haze that was the sea.</p>

<p>So lost was Sir John in the ever-changing wonder
of the scene that he started suddenly, beholding one
who had approached unheard upon the velvet ling,
a man who also surveyed the widespread landscape
with eyes of awed delight. A man, this, of no great
size yet of powerful build, a man in weather-stained
coat, open-kneed breeches and rough shoes and
stockings, yet who wore these garments with an
unconscious ease, while the face beneath shapeless
hat was well-featured and arresting; indeed, there was
about his whole person an air of breeding and refinement
that Sir John was quick to heed: in one hand he
bore a long-barrelled musket, in the other a newly slain
rabbit and upon his broad back a small colour-box.</p>

<p>“A glorious prospect, sir!” quoth Sir John.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” nodded the stranger, his gaze still upon
the distance. “’Tis a sight to fill a man with wonder,
a country to leave that a man may come back to it,
to paint because it is so unpaintable ... so simple
that it awes a man with its mystery ... a country to
live in and die in ... ’tis the Down-country, sir!”</p>

<p>“You know it well, I perceive, sir.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” answered the stranger, seating himself
upon the grass. “I know every ring, barrow and
tumulus far as you can see—and farther. I have
fished every bend o’ yon river and have painted it all
so often that I begin to know that I never shall paint
it ... no hand ever will! Though, to be sure, I
have come nigh doing so once or twice! But what
brush can suggest all the sublime majesty of these
everlasting hills, yon sweep of valley? So when I’m
tempted to try again, I generally bring Brown Bess
here that my day be not wholly in vain.” And he
patted the long weapon across his knees.</p>

<p>“Do you always shoot conies with a musket, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“Always!” nodded the painter, with sudden smile.
“’Tis a little irregular, mayhap, but ’tis more sport
to myself and fairer to the cony. If I miss, which
is seldom, my cony is unharmed; when I hit, which
I generally do, my cony is swiftly and very completely
dead.... You are a stranger hereabouts, I
think, sir?”</p>

<p>“Extremely!” answered Sir John.</p>

<p>“Aye, to be sure,” nodded the painter, smiling
grimly. “Folk in these parts don’t take kindly to
new faces——”</p>

<p>“Being all staunch believers in—free trade....
‘True-believers’?” suggested Sir John.</p>

<p>“Aha, you’ve heard o’ that elusive craft, then?”
inquired the painter, with a keen glance.</p>

<p>“And sailed aboard her a week ago!” nodded Sir
John.</p>

<p>“What—the trip they crippled the <i>Seahorse</i>?
Were this known ’twould make you at home wi’ all
the Down folk hereabouts. For, egad, sir, we’re all
smugglers, more or less, and are, on the whole, a very
orderly, peaceable community—with the exception of
that damned scoundrel, my Lord Sayle, whose life is
a scandal in every way.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of him, sir; he is said to be a dangerous
fellow—an inveterate duellist?” said Sir John.</p>

<p>“Aye, as notorious as Dering of Dering, whose
empty house stands in the valley yonder. ’Twould be
a blessing to the world in general if these two fine
gentlemen could meet and exterminate each other;
they have cumbered the earth too long—especially
my Lord Sayle, one o’ your merciless rake-hells ... a
very masterful libertine of whom I’ve heard such shameful
tales—faugh!” and the painter spat in sheer disgust.</p>

<p>“And is my lord a smuggler also?”</p>

<p>“Why, at first he winked at ‘the trade’ and took
many a bale and cask as a bribe, but later he demanded
a percentage on every cargo, and, being refused,
promptly ratted and set the law in motion, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
result that there’s been wild doings hereabouts o’
late and may be wilder yet. The excise officers will
find theirs a hard task, for, as I say, we’re all ‘in it’
more or less. I’ve drank many a glass of right Nantzy,
and even Parson Hartop, godly soul, has smoked
tobacco that hath paid no more duty than the laces on
my daughter’s petticoat. Are ye travelling far, sir?”</p>

<p>“To High Dering.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ’tis a village over yonder!” said the painter,
with a jerk of his head. “’Tis a village, sir, that labours
under a blight, a disease, a very effective curse.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed Sir John, a little startled.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The name of this particular disease is
Dering—Sir John Dering.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” sighed Sir John, “I have heard of him
also——”</p>

<p>“And little to his good, I’ll warrant!” quoth the
painter. “Dering of Dering is the biggest landlord
in these parts—and the worst.”</p>

<p>“How so, sir?”</p>

<p>“Owning so much land, he consequently owes a
duty to the county and to his tenants—a debt he hath
never paid and never will, being a poor fool, sir, a
miserable wretch who takes and gives nothing, who
passes his life in riot and debauchery shut up in Paris
salons when he might be walking these hills a free man,
honoured by his tenantry.... Are you staying long
hereabouts?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Sir John. “And my name is
Derwent.”</p>

<p>“Then, Mr. Derwent, should you find yourself
Alfriston way, come and see us. My daughter shall
brew you a dish of such tea as you seldom drank
before and that never passed the excise ... and I’ve
some French brandy——We will smoke a friendly
pipe and talk, sir, for to talk is to be alive!” So
saying, the painter got lightly to his feet and stood a
moment to survey the widespread prospect.</p>

<p>“Look around you!” quoth he. “In the brooding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
silence of these immemorial hills the long-forgotten
dead may find voices to speak of vanished peoples
whiles here we stand, you and I, alive for a little space,
yet soon to pass and vanish, as they. How glorious,
then, whiles we have life, to worship the Infinite God
within and around us, here amid these fragrant
solitudes ... and to poach an occasional rabbit!”
saying which, the painter laughed, shouldered his
musket and strode off, leaving Sir John to pursue
his solitary and pensive way, filled with a strange new
sense of responsibility, until, having descended the
Beacon, he reached a stile and, seated thereon, fell
to profound meditation.</p>

<p>Across undulating park, shaded by ancient trees,
rose the stately pile of Dering Manor, his home; in
the valley hard by, sheltered beneath lofty Firle,
nestled Dering village; all around him, far as eye
could see, the land was his: thus, as he surveyed this
goodly heritage, his sense of responsibility grew, a
feeling unknown until now.</p>

<p>From these reflections he was suddenly aroused by
feeling a sharp prod in the back, and, glancing sharply
around, beheld an old man who peered up at him from
under a well-brushed, wide-eaved hat and poked at
him with a knotted stick; a small, wrinkled, rosy-cheeked,
exquisitely neat old man in spotless frock
and highly polished boots, and who now addressed
him in querulous tones, though his bright eyes held
a lurking twinkle.</p>

<p>“Lord, young master, lordy-lord!” he quavered; “there
’ee du set s’ quiet an’ still as Peter Bunkle’s ’og as was
killed day afore yesterday ’s ever was, that ’ee du!”</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” answered Sir John, almost
apologetically.</p>

<p>“Well, I be thinkin’ tu ... I be thinkin’ ’tis
toime ’ee comed off’n stile an’ mak’ way fur a old,
ancient man as wur a-buryin’ folk older’n ’ee afore ’ee
was born, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Down got Sir John forthwith and, seeing the old man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
so feeble, reached out a hand in aid, whereupon the
ancient man swore at him, though a little breathlessly
by reason of his exertions as he climbed.</p>

<p>“Dang’ee—lemme be!” he gasped. “Du ’ee think
as oi caan’t cloimb a little bit of a stoile as I’ve clumb,
man an’ bye, for seventy year? Lemme be—an’
dang’ee twoice!” Gasping these words and with
infinite exertions the old man mounted the stile,
seated himself on the top bar in Sir John’s place and,
mopping wrinkled brow with the end of a newly washed
and ironed neckerchief of vivid hue, nodded at Sir
John in very fierce and determined fashion. “Look’ee
naow,” he panted. “I’ve set ’ere on this yer stoile
fur six-and-sixty year—ah, p’r’aps longer—every
sunny arternoon, off an’ on, and ’ere I be a-goin’ to
set ’cording to custom, so oi be—an’ dang you an’
arl! An’ what do ’ee say naow?”</p>

<p>“That you are very welcome,” smiled Sir John.
“I hope you live to sit there for many a long day;
you look hale and hearty——”</p>

<p>“Wot—me?” croaked the old man fiercely. “Me
’ale an’ ’earty! Lordy-lord, young man, ’ee must be
a gert fule not t’see as oi du be waastin’ away an’
perishin’ wi’ a disease no doctor nor ’poth’cary can
cure. There be ’poth’cary Mayfield, over tu Lewes, sez
tu me: ‘’Osea Dumbrell,’ ’e sez, ‘if I wuz tu give
’ee arl th’ drugs in my shop they wouldn’t do ’ee no
manner o’ good!’ ’e sez. An’ no wonder, for my
disease bean’t no ordinary disease—no! My disease,
young man, be a musket-ball in my in’ards as won’t
come out no-’ow!”</p>

<p>“A musket-ball!” exclaimed Sir John, staring.</p>

<p>“Ah—in me in’ards!” nodded the old man triumphantly;
“as won’t come out! An’ ’twixt you an’ me,
a preventive bullet it were. Ketched me ’ere ’twixt
wind an’ watter, it did! Six-an’-fifty years ago come
Martinmas, an’ brings up agin me backbone wi’ a
crack as nigh deafened me; ah, it be gert wonder as
it didn’t kill oi stone-dead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed, yes!” murmured Sir John.</p>

<p>“An’ theer it du bide ever since, young man. I can
feel it! Whens’ever oi walks tu fast or coughs a spell,
that theer old musket-ball goes a-rollin’ an’ a-rattlin’
about in me pore old in’ards summat crool, lordy-lord!
Las’ toime I seed Doctor Blake, t’ surgeon, about ’un,
’e shook ’is ’ead solemn-loike: ‘You’m a-goin’ t’ die,
’Osea Dumbrell,’ ’e sez. ‘Aye,’ I sez, ‘so be you,
doctor, but as fur oi—when?’ ‘When ye du,’ ’e sez,
‘’twill be mortal sudden!’ ’e sez. That wur years an’
years ago, an’ ’ere be I alive an’ kickin’.... Doan’t
seem right some’ow, fur doctor be mortal knowin’.
But I doan’t look much loike dyin’, du I?</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” answered Sir John. “And you are
surely the neatest, smartest——”</p>

<p>“That’ll du—that’ll du!” croaked the ancient man
angrily. “’Tidn’t my fault! Don’t ’ee go a-blamin’
of oi—blame me granddarter Ann! Her du be for ever
a-washin’ an’ a-breshin’ an’ a-cleanin’ o’ me, till it be
gert wonder ’er don’t scrub me into me grave! Combed
all th’ ’air off’n me ’ead, she ’ave, an’ now combin’
out arl me whiskers—what be left of ’em! ’Tidn’t
respectful—no! ’Ef ’ee du get dirty,’ ’er sez tu me,
‘no baccy!’ ’er sez—a crool ’ard creeter be me granddarter
Ann! Look at me boots, so bright an’
shinin’—I dassent go a-nigh a bit o’ mud! An’ I
loike mud—leastways a bit o’ mud don’t nowise ’arm
nobody, an’ when it be forbid I could waller in it,
j’yful—ah, an’ I will one o’ these days an’ dang arl!
A crool, flinty-’earted, brimstone witch be my granddart——”</p>

<p>“Granfer!” called a soft voice at no great distance.
“Granfer!”</p>

<p>“By goles!” ejaculated the ancient; and skipping
down from the stile with surprising agility, he was in
the act of brushing imaginary dust from his immaculate
smock-frock when round a bend in the lane there
appeared a shapely young woman who, coming thus
unexpectedly upon Sir John, blushed very prettily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
and dropped him a curtsy, then turned to glance at
one standing immediately behind her, a tall, square-shouldered,
powerful-looking fellow who, meeting Sir
John’s quick, bright glance, flushed also, from square
chin to the curls of very neat wig that showed beneath
neat hat, and, flushing, bowed, though remarkably
stiff in the back about it.</p>

<p>“Come, Granfer,” said the girl, “it be toime ye
took your egg-an’-milk!”</p>

<p>“Cruel and flinty-hearted?” murmured Sir John
reproachfully. “O Mr. Dumbrell!”</p>

<p>“Hesh-hesh!” whispered the ancient fiercely.</p>

<p>“Are ye catchin’ cold, Granfer deary?”</p>

<p>“Brimstone witch? O Mr. Dumbrell!”</p>

<p>“Who be the man ahint ye, Nan?” demanded the
old man, pointing with his stick.</p>

<p>“Only the gentleman as took my part’s marnin’
agin Mr. Sturton, Granfer.”</p>

<p>“Sturton!” snarled the ancient, flourishing stick
in tremulous hand. “Sturton—dang ’im! Ef I
ketch ’im tryin’ t’ kiss ’ee, lass, I’ll break ’is ’ead for
’im so old as I be—aye, I will, an’ ’e can turn us out
o’ th’ ow’d cottage arter if ’e loikes—dang ’im! Doan’t
’ee forget pore Mary Beal as drownded ’erself las’ year
arl along o’ Sturton——”</p>

<p>“There, there, Granfer, you be gettin’ arl of a shake!
That’ll du now, that’ll du or—no puddin’ fur your
supper, mind that.”</p>

<p>“Arl right, lass, arl right! Only when I du think
o’ that Sturton——”</p>

<p>“Then don’t ’ee, Granfer, or not a scrinch o’ sugar
or nutmeg in y’r egg-an’-milk an’ nary a spot o’ rum.
So be a good lad an’ come ’long o’ me!”</p>

<p>“Well, Robert,” quoth Sir John, seating himself on
the stile again so soon as they were alone, “my letter
reached you in time, then?”</p>

<p>“And I’m here in conse-quence, sir!”</p>

<p>“What is all this about Sturton?”</p>

<p>Ex-Corporal Robert shifted his right foot slightly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
and raising stiff arm, coughed deprecatingly behind
a discreet hand.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he answered, “I regret to be obleeged to
inform your honour that I opened hostilities this
morning without your honour’s orders, feeling myself
obligated thereto by reason of a young fe-male——”</p>

<p>“I suggest ‘maid,’ Robert.”</p>

<p>“Maid, your honour, which young female crying
out——”</p>

<p>“Damsel, Robert.”</p>

<p>“Damsel, your honour ... crying out, sir, I
observed said young fe——”</p>

<p>“Nymph, Robert.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I ob-served same a-struggling with Mr.
Sturton. Whereupon, your honour, judging the ser-cumstances
called for indi-vidual action, I opened
hos-tilities forthwith.”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Sturton receive any—injuries, Robert?”</p>

<p>“Only super-facially, sir. His right ogle, your
honour; otherwise he retreated in fairly good order,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Whiles you comforted the distressed damsel,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“I did my endeavour, sir,” answered the ex-corporal,
imperturbable as ever.</p>

<p>“Extreme commendable in you, Robert, for hitherto
you have not been precisely a ‘squire o’ dames.’”</p>

<p>“Heretofore, sir, I have preferred horses.”</p>

<p>“And egad,” sighed Sir John wistfully, “’twould
almost seem you were the wiser, Bob! For though
horses may balk they cannot talk, they may break
your neck but they cannot break your heart....
’S life, Bob, ’tis subject suggestive for a lampoon on
the Sex!... ‘The Jade Equine and Feminine,’ or
‘The Horse the Nobler Animal.’ ... It promiseth,
Robert, it promiseth!... Hum! Though horses
may balk, women will talk; break your necks, falsest
sex. Though horses unseat ye they cannot ill-treat
ye. What though they be glandered no fame ha’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
they slandered. Though horses go lame they never
defame. Yes, it promiseth exceeding well!” and out
came Sir John’s memorandum. And after he had
been thus busied for some minutes, Robert the Imperturbable
spoke:</p>

<p>“Pray what are your honour’s orders?”</p>

<p>“Orders?” repeated Sir John, glancing up a little
vacantly. “Though they be spavined ... spavined?
’Twon’t do—’tis a devilish awkward word—eh, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir ... and your orders?”</p>

<p>“Aye, to be sure,” sighed Sir John, “you will
pursue every inquiry and research in regard to Mr.
James Sturton ... and inquire for me at the ‘Dering
Arms’ about six o’clock this evening.”</p>

<p>“As Mr. Derwent, your honour?”</p>

<p>“As Mr. Derwent. And, by the way, Bob ...
concerning the granddaughter of our ancient Mr.
Dumbrell—her name is Ann, I think?”</p>

<p>“So I am give to understand, sir.”</p>

<p>“She is a fine, handsome creature, Robert?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour.”</p>

<p>“With a neat foot and a low, sweet voice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Some sage philosopher hath it, Bob, that ‘a
pretty foot is the one element of beauty that defieth
Time,’ but I, who pretend to some little discernment
in such matters, incline to the belief that a low, soft-sweet
voice may endure even longer.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, your honour?”</p>

<p>“Remembering which ... and Mr. Sturton’s
apparently unwelcome attentions, I think ’twere as
well you should keep an eye on old Mr. Dumbrell’s
granddaughter, Robert.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir!” answered the ex-corporal, and
with a movement that was something between bow
and salute, he wheeled and strode away, leaving Sir
John, perched upon the stile, hard at work upon his
lampoon.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW THE MAN OF SENTIMENT SENTIMENTALISED IN A DITCH</span></h2>

</div>

<p>He was not to remain long undisturbed, it seemed,
for presently upon the stilly air was the faint,
regular tapping of a stick that drew gradually nearer,
and glancing up he saw an old woman approaching,
one who trudged sturdily with the aid of a formidable
staff and bore a large wooden basket on her arm;
a tall old creature with a great jut of nose and chin
and fierce bright eyes that glittered beneath thick
brows, whose jetty-black contrasted very strangely
with her snow-white hair. But just now these fierce
old eyes were dimmed with tears, and more than once
she sniffed loud and dolorously; perceiving which
and noting how she laboured with the heavy-laden
basket, Sir John pocketed his tablets and rose. But,
quite lost in her grief, the old creature paused to sob
and sniff and wipe away her tears with a corner of her
shawl, in the doing of which she let fall her basket,
scattering its contents broadcast in the dust. At
this calamity she wailed distressfully, and was in the
act of bending her old joints to collect her property
when she was aware of one who did this for her, a
slender, very nimble young man, at sight of whom
she forgot her troubles a while, watching him in mute
surprise, yet quick to heed the white delicacy of these
hands as they darted here and there collecting the
bundles of herbs and simples with the other more
homely vegetables that lay so widely scattered. Thus
Sir John, happening to glance up as he stooped for a
large cabbage, met the fixed scrutiny of a pair of black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
eyes, so fierce and keenly direct beneath their jutting
brows that he stared back, surprised and a little
disconcerted.</p>

<p>“My good dame, why d’ye stare so?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“I dream, young sir! Your bright eyes do ha’
set me a-dreamin’ o’ other days ... better days ...
when the world was younger ... an’ kinder. Old
I be an’ tur’ble lonesome, but I ha’ my dreams ...
’tis arl the years ha’ left me.... But why must ye
meddle wi’ the likes o’ me?” ... she demanded in
sudden ferocity. “Why don’t ’ee cross y’r fingers
or mak’ ‘the horns’ agin me?”</p>

<p>“Why should I?” he inquired, wondering.</p>

<p>“Because they du say as I’ve the ‘evil eye’ an’
can blight a man wi’ a look as easy as I can a pig ...
or a cow.”</p>

<p>“To be sure your eyes are very strange and bright,”
he answered gently, “and must have been very
beautiful once, like yourself—when the world was
younger.”</p>

<p>“Beautiful,” she repeated in changed tone; and
her eyes grew less keen, the harsh lines of her fierce,
old face softening wonderfully. “Beautiful?” said
she again. “Aye, so I was, years agone ... though
there be few as would believe it o’ me now an’ fewer
eyes sharp enough t’ see.... An’ you bean’t
fruttened o’ me then, young man?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not frightened,” answered Sir John.</p>

<p>“Why then,” quoth she, “when you’m done wi’
that cabbage o’ mine, there be an onion over yonder,
agin the dik!” Sir John deposited the cabbage, and
having retrieved the errant onion, added this also to
the well-laden basket.</p>

<p>“That is all, I think?” said he, glancing about.</p>

<p>“Aye!” she nodded. “An’ it be plain t’ know you
be a stranger hereabouts. There bean’t a man nor
bye, aye, an’ mortal few o’ the women, would ha’
stooped to du so much for poor old Penelope Haryott,
I reckon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“And pray why not?”</p>

<p>“Because they say I be a witch, an’ they be arl
main fruttened o’ me, an’ them as say they ain’t, du
hate me most. Aye, me! I’ve been thrattened wi’
the fire afore now; an’ only las’ March, an’ main cold
it were, they was for a-duckin’ o’ me in the Cuckmere....
Ah, an’ they’d ha’ done it tu if Passon Hartop
’adn’t galloped over tu Alfriston an’ fetched Sir Hector
MacLean as knew me years ago, an’ Jarge Potter as
I’ve dandled a babe on my knee. Sir Hector were
main fierce again the crowd an’ swore t’ cut any man’s
throat as dared tetch me, an’ Jarge Potter ’ad on his
old frieze coat—so the crowd let me go ... they
ain’t tried to harm me since.... But ’tis very sure
you be a stranger in these parts, young man.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes!” sighed Sir John, once more oppressed
by the sense of his responsibility and of the duties
left undone.</p>

<p>“An’ yet there be a look about ’ee, young man, as
do whisper me you was barn here in Sussex an’ not
s’ fur away, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Oh ... begad!” he exclaimed, starting. “What
should make you think so, pray?”</p>

<p>“Y’r hands, young sir, the high cock o’ your chin,
y’r pretty eyes ... they do mind me of other eyes
as looked into mine ... long afore you was barn ...
when the world was happier.... Though ’e were
bigger’n you, young man ... so tall an’ noble-lookin’!
Alack, ’twas long ago an’ the world be changed for the
worse since then—’specially High Dering! Aye, me!
I’ll be a-goin’, young sir, thankin’ ye for your kindness
to a solitary old woman.”</p>

<p>“How far are you going?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“Only to the village yonder.”</p>

<p>“This basket is much too heavy for you.”</p>

<p>“Lud, young master, I do be stronger than I look!”
she answered, with a mirthless laugh. “Aye, tur’ble
strong I be or I should ha’ died years agone, I reckon.
So doan’t ’ee trouble, sir ... besides, folk ’ud stare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
t’ see s’fine a young man along o’ me, an’ a-carryin’
my old trug an’ arl ... so let be!”</p>

<p>Sir John smiled, took up the basket, reached his
stick whence it leaned against the stile and set off
with old Penelope Haryott, suiting his pace to hers
and talking with such blithe ease that old Penelope,
forgetting her rustic pride at last, talked in her turn,
as she might have done “when the world was younger
and better.”</p>

<p>“Ah yes, I mind Sir Hector years agone, when he
were jest Mr. Hector an’ friend t’ Sir John Dering—him
as was the ‘real’ Sir John as lived at ‘the gert
house’ yonder an’ married here ... an’ marched
away t’ the wars wi’ Mr. Hector, both s’fine in their
red coats, and him s’handsome an’ gay ... him as
was killed an’ never come marchin’ back.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Sir John as she paused. “So you
knew Sir John Dering, the Sir John who was killed
years ago in Flanders? Pray tell me of him.”</p>

<p>“An’ why should I?” quoth the old woman in
sudden anger. “He’s been dead long years an’ forgot,
I reckon. But when he lived the world was a better
place ... ’specially High Dering! Aye, he was
... a man!”</p>

<p>“And what,” questioned Sir John wistfully, “what
of the new Sir John Dering?”</p>

<p>Old Penelope spat contemptuously and trudged on
a little faster.</p>

<p>“Take care o’ my old trug, young man,” she admonished;
“the ’andle be main loose! Aye, me, if
my troubles was no ’eavier than that theer trug I’d
bear’em j’yful!”</p>

<p>“Are you so greatly troubled, then?” he asked
gently.</p>

<p>“Ah, more’n my share, I reckon! And an old
woman so solitary as I be must allus go full o’ sorrow!”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me some of your sorrows, old
Penelope?”</p>

<p>“Why should I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>“Because I ask reverently and respect you.”</p>

<p>“Respect! Me?” she muttered. “Respect?
O kind Lord, ’tis a strange word in my old ears!
Folks mostly curse me ... the children throws stones
at me! ’Tis an ill thing to be named a witch ... an’
all because I can see deeper and further than most
fules, can read the good an’ evil in faces an’ know a
sight about yarbs an’ simples. An’ they’re fruttened
o’ me, the fules ... ah, an’ they need be, some on
’em—’specially one!”</p>

<p>“You were weeping when I saw you first, Penelope;
yet tears do not come easily with you, I judge.”</p>

<p>“Tears?” she exclaimed fiercely. “An’ yet I’ve
shed s’ many ’tis gert wonder there be any left. ’Tis
wonnerful how much one woman can weep in one
lifetime, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“And why did you weep to-day?”</p>

<p>“’Tidn’t no manner o’ business o’ yourn, young
man!” she exclaimed bitterly.</p>

<p>“Why, then, pray forgive me!” he answered, with
a little bow; at this she stared and immediately spoke
in changed voice.</p>

<p>“I wep’, sir, because this day week I’m to be turned
out o’ doors wi’ never a roof to shelter me—unless
some o’ the neighbours offers—which they won’t ...
Lord, tak’ care o’ the trug, young man, if ye swing it
so fierce ’twill go to pieces!”</p>

<p>“Why are you being turned out?”</p>

<p>“Because they be arl fruttened o’ me—an’ him most
of arl——”</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean by ‘him’?”</p>

<p>But old Penelope tramped on unheeding, only she
muttered to herself fiercely.</p>

<p>“Do you dread the future so greatly, Penelope?”</p>

<p>“No!” she answered sturdily. “I bean’t fruttened
o’ now’t but fire ... an’ dogs!”</p>

<p>“Dogs?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“Aye, young man, they du set ’em on me sometimes,
’tis why I carry this gert staff ... killed a dog<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
wi’ it once, I did—though I were badly bit! So they
clapped me in the stocks, the dog was valleyble, y’ see,
an’ chanced to belong to Lord Sayle, him as du live at
the great ’ouse ’Friston way.”</p>

<p>Talking thus, they became aware of leisured hoof-strokes
behind them, and, turning to stare, old Penelope
pointed suddenly at the approaching rider with her
long staff.</p>

<p>“Yonder ’e comes!” she whispered fiercely; “him as
ought t’ be dead an’ gibbeted ... him as be afeart o’ me!”</p>

<p>Glancing round in turn, Sir John beheld a man
bestriding a large, plump steed, a man who rode at a
hand-pace, apparently lost in thought; thus Sir John
had full time to observe him narrowly as he approached.</p>

<p>He seemed a prosperous and highly respectable man,
for he went in broadcloth and fine linen; but his
garments, devoid of all embellishings, were of sober
hue, so that, looked at from behind, he might have
been an itinerant preacher with a hint of the Quaker,
but seen from in front, the narrow eyes, predatory
nose, vulperine mouth and fleshy chin stamped him
as being like nothing in life but himself.</p>

<p>Slowly he approached, until, suddenly espying the
old woman, he urged his somnolent horse to quicker
gait and rode towards her, brandishing the stick he
carried.</p>

<p>“Damned hag,” cried he, “you ought to burn!”</p>

<p>“Dirty twoad,” she retorted, “you’d ought to
hang!” At this, the man struck at her passionately,
and, being out of reach, spurred his powerful horse as
if to ride her down; but Sir John, setting by the
basket, sprang and caught the bridle.</p>

<p>“Steady, sir, steady!” quoth he mildly.</p>

<p>“Mind your own business!” cried the horseman.</p>

<p>“Faith, sir,” answered Sir John ruefully, “’tis high
time I did, ’twould seem. And indeed I propose
doing so, but in my own fashion. And first I desire
to learn why you ride the king’s highway to the
common danger——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, and who the devil might you be?”</p>

<p>“One who hath played divers rôles, sir,” answered
Sir John. “Just at present I find myself a Man o’
Sentiment, full o’ loving-kindness, especially to sorrowful
old age——”</p>

<p>“What the devil!” exclaimed the horseman,
staring.</p>

<p>“Come then, sir, let us together bare our heads in
homage to Age, Sorrow and Womanhood in the person
of this much-enduring Mistress Haryott!” and off
came Sir John’s hat forthwith.</p>

<p>“Are ye mad?” demanded the other scornfully.
“Are ye mad or drunk, my lad?”</p>

<p>“Sir, a Man of Sentiment is never——”</p>

<p>“Curse your sentiment! Let me warn ye that yon
hag is a notorious evil-liver and a damned witch——”</p>

<p>“Which as a Man of Sentiment——”</p>

<p>“Hold y’r tongue, d’ye hear! She’s a witch, I tell
ye, so tak’ my advice, my lad, throw that old trug
o’ her’n over the hedge and leave her to the devil!
And now loose my bridle; I’m done.”</p>

<p>“But I am not, sir!” answered Sir John. “You
attempted to strike a woman in my presence, and
have dared allude to me twice as your ‘lad’—two
very heinous offences——”</p>

<p>“Loose my bridle or ’twill be the worse for ye.
D’ye know who I am?”</p>

<p>“Judging by your right eye, sir, its rainbow colouring,
I opine you must be Mr. James Sturton——”</p>

<p>“Damn your insolence—leggo my bridle!”</p>

<p>But instead of complying, Sir John gave a sudden
twist to the bit, whereupon the plump and somnolent
steed waked to sudden action, insomuch that Mr.
Sturton was nearly unseated and his hat tumbled
off; whereupon Sir John deftly skewered it upon the
end of his stick and tossed it over the hedge; and
old Penelope, watching its brief flight, uttered a
single screech of laughter and was immediately silent
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Sturton, having quieted his horse, raised his
stick and struck viciously, but Sir John, deftly parrying
the blow, answered it with a thrust, a lightning riposte
that took his aggressor full upon fleshy chin. Mr.
Sturton dropped his stick, clapped hand to chin and,
seeing his own blood, spurred madly upon Sir John,
who, in escaping the lashing hoofs, tripped and fell
into the ditch.</p>

<p>“Let that learn ye!” cried Mr. Sturton, exultantly
shaking his fist. “A ditch is the proper place for
you, my lad.... I only hope as you’ve broke a
bone.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Sir John, sitting up, and
groping for his hat, “I find myself very well, for:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Though in posture unheroic</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You behold me still a stoic.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, further, here’s a truth, sir, which is:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are places worse than ditches!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Indeed, Mr. Sturton,” he added, leaning back in the
ditch and folding his arms, “’tis in my mind that you
may find yourself yearning passionately for a good,
dry ditch one o’ these days.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” cried the other contemptuously. “If ye
can crawl—crawl and bring me my hat.”</p>

<p>“The heavens,” answered Sir John, pointing
thither with graceful flourish, “the heavens shall fall
first, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ha, now—look’ee! You’ll bring me my hat,
young man, or I’ll march you and yon vile old beldam
into Dering and ha’ ye clapped into the stocks together
for assault on the highway! D’ye hear?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” answered Sir John, “a fiddlestick!”</p>

<p>Uttering an angry exclamation, Mr. Sturton whipped
a pistol from his holster, but as he did so, old Penelope
whirled her long staff which, missing him by a fraction,
took effect upon his horse, whereupon this much-enduring
animal promptly bolted and galloped
furiously away with Mr. Sturton in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>“Lord ha’ mercy!” gasped old Penelope as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
galloping hoof-beats blurred and died away. “Lord,
what ’ave I done?”</p>

<p>“Removed an offence by a mere flourish o’ your
magic wand, like the fairy godmother you are!”
answered Sir John. “Mistress Penelope, accept my
thanks—I salute you!” And, standing up in the
ditch, he bowed gravely.</p>

<p>“Ha’ done, young man, ha’ done!” she cried distressfully.
“He’ll raise the village again’ me ...
he’ll ha’ me in the stocks again—an’ arl along o’ you!
An’ I can’t bear they stocks like I used to ... they
cramps my old bones s’cruel.... O Lord ha’ mercy!
The stocks!” And, leaning on her staff, she bowed
her white head and sobbed miserably.</p>

<p>In a moment Sir John was out of the ditch and,
standing beside her, laid one white hand upon her
shoulder, patting it gently.</p>

<p>“Penelope,” said he softly, “don’t weep! No man
shall do you violence.... I swear none shall harm
you any more ... so be comforted!”</p>

<p>“An’ who be you t’ promise s’much?” she demanded
fiercely.</p>

<p>“One who will keep his word——”</p>

<p>“I be so old,” she wailed—“so old an’ lonesome
an’ weary of ’t all.”</p>

<p>“But very courageous!” he added gently. “And
I think, Penelope, nay, I’m sure there are better days
coming for you—and me. So come, let us go on,
confident in ourselves and the future.”</p>

<p>And taking stick and basket in one hand, he slipped
the other within his aged companion’s arm and they
tramped on again.</p>

<p>“You speak mighty bold, young man!” said she
after a while, with another of her keen glances. “Aye,
an’ look mighty bold—why?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps because I feel mighty bold!” he answered
lightly.</p>

<p>“Aye, like ye did when he knocked ye into the
ditch, young man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“The ditch?” repeated Sir John. “Aye, begad,
the ditch! ’S heart, it needed but this!” And here
he laughed so blithely that old Penelope stared and,
forgetting her recent tears, presently smiled.</p>

<p>“Ye tumbled so ’mazin’ sudden, young man,” she
nodded. “An’ then I never ’eerd no one talk po’try
in a dik’ afore.”</p>

<p>“And you probably never will again, Penelope.
The occasion was unique and my extempore rhymes
none too bad.”</p>

<p>“Eh—eh, young man, did ye mak’ ’em up ...
a-settin’ in t’ dik’ ... arl out o’ y’r head? Lord!”</p>

<p>So they reached the village at last, its deep-thatched
cottages nestled beneath the sheltering down; a
quiet, sleepy place where a brook gurgled pleasantly
and rooks cawed lazily amid lofty, ancient trees; a
place of peace, it seemed, very remote from the world.</p>

<p>But, as they went, rose a stir, a flutter, a growing
bustle; heads peered from casements, from open
doorways and dim interiors; children ceased their
play to point, a woman laughed shrilly, men, home-coming
from the fields, stood to stare, to laugh, to hoot
and jeer; and foremost, among a group of loungers
before the ancient inn, Sir John espied Mr. Sturton.</p>

<p>And thus amid hoots, jeers and derisive laughter
came Sir John to High Dering.</p>

<span class="smaller">WHICH INTRODUCES A FRIEZE COAT AND ITS WEARER, ONE GEORGE POTTER</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“Old gammer du ha’ found ’ersen a man at
last!” cried a voice.</p>

<p>“Ah, the danged owd witch du ha’ ’witched hersel’
a sweet’eart fur sure!” roared another.</p>

<p>“An’ sech a nice-lookin’ young man an’ arl!”
quoth a matron with a fat baby in her arms, whom
Sir John saluted with a bow, whereupon she hid
blushing face behind her plump baby.</p>

<p>But as they progressed the crowd grew and, with
increasing number, their attitude waxed more threatening;
laughter changed to angry mutterings, clods
and stones began to fly.</p>

<p>“I waarned ’ee ’ow ’twould be!” quoth old Penelope
bitterly. “You’d best leave me an’ run, young man,
quick—up the twitten yonder!” Even as she spoke,
Sir John was staggered by a well-aimed clod and his
hat spun from his head. Setting down the basket, he
turned and stood fronting the crowd frowning a little,
chin uptilted, serene of eye. Foremost among their
assailants was a burly young fellow, chiefly remarkable
for a very wide mouth and narrow-set eyes, towards
whom Sir John pointed with his holly-stick.</p>

<p>“Pray, Mistress Haryott,” he inquired in his clear,
ringing tones, “who is yonder ill-conditioned wight?”</p>

<p>“That?” cried old Penelope in fierce scorn. “It
be Tom Simpson, a Lon’on lad ... one o’ th’ Excise
as creeps an’ crawls an’ spies on better men——”</p>

<p>“Oh, do I, then!” snarled the burly young man.
“I’ll knock your dummed eye out for that, I will!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
And he reached for a stone, but checked suddenly as
Sir John strode towards him carrying the holly-stick
much as if it had been a small-sword.</p>

<p>“Talking of eyes,” quoth Sir John, with a graceful
flourish of the stick, “drop that stone, lest I feel it
necessary to blind you!” and he made an airy pass
at the face of the young man, who leapt back so precipitately
that he stumbled and fell, whereupon the
crowd, roaring with laughter at his discomfiture,
pressed nearer, eager for diversion.</p>

<p>“Doan’t let ’un bloind ’ee, lad!” cried one.</p>

<p>“’E bean’t so big as ’ee, Tom! Tak’ a ’edge-stake
tu un!”</p>

<p>“Noa, tak’ my ol’ bat; it du be a good ’eavy ’un,
Tom!” cried a second.</p>

<p>The burly young man, finding himself thus the centre
of observation, snatched the proffered stick, squared
his shoulders and approached Sir John in very ferocious
and determined manner, but halted, just out of reach,
to spit upon his palm and take fresh hold upon his
bludgeon; whereupon the crowd encouraged him on
this wise:</p>

<p>“Knock ’is little wig off, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Poke ’is eye out, lad!”</p>

<p>“Aim at ’is nob!”</p>

<p>“Go fur ’is legs!”</p>

<p>Suddenly the burly young man sprang, aiming a
terrific blow, but, instead of attempting a parry, Sir
John leapt nimbly aside, and the young man, impelled
by the force of his stroke, once more stumbled and fell;
and then before he could rise, old Penelope commenced
to belabour him with her long staff as he lay, panting
out maledictions with every blow until the crowd,
laughing, shouting, cursing, surged forward to the
rescue. Drawing the fierce and breathless old creature
behind him, Sir John, seeing escape impossible, faced
the oncoming menace strung and quivering for
desperate action, while the crowd lashed itself to fury
by such cries as:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“Down wi’ the young cock!”</p>

<p>“Scrag the owd witch, lads: to the watter wi’ ’er!”</p>

<p>“Aye, to the river with ’em—both of ’em!” cried
Mr. Sturton, loudest of all.</p>

<p>And then forth from one of those narrow lanes, or
rather passages that are known as “twittens,” sauntered
a man in a short, frieze coat, vast of pocket and button,
a wide-shouldered, comely man whose face, framed
between neatly trimmed whiskers, wore an air of
guileless good-nature. Guilelessness indeed! It was
in his eyes despite their lurking twinkle, in the uptrend
of his firm lips, the tilt of his nose, his close-cropped
whiskers and square chin. Guilelessness beamed in
the brass buttons of his short-skirted frieze coat, it
was in the very creases of his garments, it seemed
to enfold him from boots and gaiters to the crown of his
weather-worn hat, it was in the tones of his soft yet
resonant voice when he spoke:</p>

<p>“Lor’ love Potter, Mr. Sturton, sir, but ’oo’s been
an’ give ye that theer tur’ble eye? Arl black it be,
sir, leastways where it bean’t black ’tis green. An’
swole, sir! Lor’ love George Potter’s limbs, it du be
a-swellin’ an’ a-puffin’ of itself up that proud, sir!
’Tis most alarmin’, Mr. Sturton! Shame on ye,
neighbours; can’t none on ye du nothin’ fur poor
Mr. Sturton’s ogle—look at ’ee——” But, uttering
a fierce imprecation, Mr. Sturton turned his back,
pushed his way angrily into the inn, and slammed
the door behind him.</p>

<p>“I never seen a blacker eye, never——”</p>

<p>“Don’t go fur to blame we, Jarge Potter!” quoth a
greybeard. “’Tidn’t none o’ our doin’—no!”</p>

<p>“Then what be the trouble, neighbours? What’s
to du, good folk?” inquired Mr. Potter.</p>

<p>“It ain’t none o’ your business anyway!” retorted
the burly young man sullenly. “We be honest folks,
which be more than some can say with y’r poachin’,
ah, an’ smugglin’!”</p>

<p>“Hold thy tongue, lad!” cried the greybeard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
plucking the burly young man’s arm. “Don’t ’ee see
as Jarge be wearin’ ’is ol’ frieze coat?”</p>

<p>“What do I care for ’is old coat!”</p>

<p>“That’s because ye be fullish an’ strange ’ereabouts
an’ doan’t know Jarge.”</p>

<p>“Neighbours,” said Mr. Potter in his deep, leisured
tones, his placid gaze roving from face to face, “you
arl do know as Potter be a peaceable man, so here’s
Potter a-beggin’ an’ a-pleadin’ o’ ye to leave old Pen
alone—or I’m afeard some on ye might get ’urted—bad,
I reckon!” As he spoke, Mr. Potter’s powerful
hands disappeared into the deep pockets of his frieze
coat, and he took a leisurely pace forward. “Simpson,
my lad,” quoth he, nodding kindly at the burly young
man, “your mouth’s so oncommon large as you’ll
swaller yourself, boots an’ arl, one of these days if ye
open it s’wide! So run along, my lad! ’Ome be
the word, neighbours; off wi’ ye now—arl on ye. I
bean’t a-goin’ t’ plead twice wi’ no one.”</p>

<p>Mr. Potter’s brow was smooth, guilelessness seemed
to radiate and beam from his person, but, seeing how
the crowd forthwith scattered and melted away, the
burly young man betook himself off likewise, muttering
darkly.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Potter turned in his unhurried fashion to
look at Sir John, and the smile that lurked in the
corners of his mouth slowly broadened.</p>

<p>“Young sir,” said he, touching his hat, “who you
be or what, bean’t no consarn o’ mine nohow, but,
sir, you stood up for a old ’ooman as aren’t got many
to tak’ ’er part, d’ye see, an’ so ’ere’s Potter a-thankin’
of you—an’ that is my business, I rackon.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mr. Potter, ’twould seem I have to thank
you also, you—or your coat——”</p>

<p>“Coat?” repeated Mr. Potter, glancing down at
the garment in question as if mildly surprised to
behold it. “Aye, to be sure—’tis a old jacket as I
use in my trade, d’ye see——”</p>

<p>“A free-trade, I think?” added Sir John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>“Lor’ love ’ee, sir,” sighed Mr. Potter, opening
his guileless eyes a trifle wider, “doan’t ’ee tak’ no
’eed o’ what that theer young Simpson says——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Potter,” quoth Sir John, smiling, “a week
ago I was shaking hands with Captain Sharkie Nye
aboard the <i>True Believer</i>, and I should like to shake
yours.”</p>

<p>“What, be you the young gen’leman as crossed
wi’ Sir Hector?”</p>

<p>“That same. And my name is Derwent.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Derwent, sir, that du alter the case, I
rackon. So theer be Potter’s ’and, sir, and heartily!
Ah, an’ yonder be old Penelope a-beckonin’ ... her
will curse we shameful if us du keep her waitin’ ...
so come ’long, sir.”</p>

<p>“Aye, come y’r ways, du—both on ye!” cried the
old creature imperiously. “’Tidn’t often I ’as comp’ny,
so I’ll brew ye a dish o’ tay——”</p>

<p>“Tea?” exclaimed Sir John.</p>

<p>“Aye, all the way from Chaney, young man! Tay
as costes forty shillin’ a pound an’ more up to Lunnon—tak’
care o’ my old trug! This way—down
twitten!”</p>

<p>She led them down a narrow way between the walls
of cottages and gardens, and at last to a very small
cottage indeed, a forlorn little structure, its garden
trampled, its broken window-panes stuffed with old
rags to exclude the elements, itself all dilapidation
from rotting thatch to crumbling doorstep.</p>

<p>“And is this your home?” cried Sir John, very
much aghast.</p>

<p>“It be, young man. They bruk’ all my lattices
months agone, an’ Mr. Sturton won’t put in no more.
The chimbley smokes an’ the thatch leaks an’ I gets
the ager bad, but it be my home an’ I love every
brick. For ’twas here I were born, here I loved and
lost, here I hoped to die, but Maaster Sturton be fur
turning o’ me out next month ... bean’t ’e,
Jarge?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“’E be,” answered Mr. Potter softly, “dang ’im!”</p>

<p>“Come in, young man, an’ you tu, Jarge—come
in; it du be better-lookin’ inside than out.” And
indeed, once the door was shut—a particularly stout
and ponderous door, Sir John noticed—the small,
heavily beamed chamber was cosy and homelike,
very orderly and clean, from the polished copper kettle
on the hob to the china ornaments upon the mantel.</p>

<p>And now Mr. Potter reached a hand within the
mysteries of the frieze coat and drew thence a couple
of plump rabbits.</p>

<p>“Found ’em s’marnin’, Pen,” he nodded. “An’
here,” he continued, groping deeper within vast pocket,
“’ere be a—no, that be wire ... ’ere—no, that be
’baccy for ’Osea ... ah, ’ere be a lump o’ pork t’ go
wi’ ’em, Pen.”</p>

<p>“Thank’ee kindly, Jarge! An’ would ’ee moind
a-skinnin’ of ’em whiles I tidies myself up a bit?”</p>

<p>“Heartily, Pen.”</p>

<p>“An’ you, young man, poke up the fire an’ put on
the kittle t’ bile ... there be a pump in the yard.”</p>

<p>Having performed these duties, Sir John, seating
himself on a bucket beside the pump, watched Mr.
Potter deftly operate upon the rabbits, and there
ensued the following conversation:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Stayin’ ’ereabouts, sir?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: At the ‘Dering Arms.’</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Stayin’ long, sir?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: I hope so.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Why, so du I ... seein’ as you be
known to Sharkie an’ Sir ’Ector. And, besides,
old Pen du ha’ took to ye fair amazin’ ... an’
she’s an eye like a nawk ’as old Pen, aye, sharp
as a gimblet it be. An’ she’s took to ye, d’ye see,
sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: I feel truly and deeply honoured.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Well, you stood up for ’er s’arternoon
agin them fules as meant mischief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: She seems to have suffered more than her
share.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Suffered? Sir, Potter be a peaceable
man an’ bloodshed contrariwise to ’is natur’ ...
no matter what you ’appen to hear ... but
there be some folk as I’d tak’ a deal o’ j’y to
skin, d’ye see, like this ’ere! (Mr. Potter held
up a newly skinned and pinkly nude rabbit.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Whom do you mean?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Ah! ’oo indeed, sir? Potter knows,
but Potter’s mum!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: And yet I think I could guess, if I tried.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Why, ye may guess, sir—this be a free
country—leastways, fules say so.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: One, I think, must be Mr. James Sturton.
Am I right?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Why, as to that, sir, I answers plain
and to the point as there be nobody nowhere
breathin’ as can get s’much flavour into a jugged
’are ekal to old Pen—except Peter Bunkle as
keeps the ‘Cross’ over tu Alfriston.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: And the second is Lord Sayle. Am I
wrong?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Why, as to that, sir, Potter don’t say
nothing. Du ’ee know Lord Sayle?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: I have met him.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Friend o’ yourn, sir?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: So much so that I have determined to
drive him out of the country, or kill him.</p>

<p>(Here Mr. Potter dropped the rabbit.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Well ... love my limbs! Kill—hist!
But ... but you, sir? Axing your pardon, but
you aren’t got the look of a killer.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Thank you, Mr. Potter, I rejoice to
hear it.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: But—ki—hist! He be pretty big and
pretty fierce, sir, an’ you, axing y’r pardon, ain’t
exactly——</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: An elephant or a tiger—and yet I feel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
myself perfectly able to accomplish one or the
other, Mr. Potter.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Well, love my eyes! He be a fightin’
man too, sir! Somebody stuck a sword into him
lately, I hear, but it didn’t do no good; he be as
well and ’earty as ever. Now if—hist!</p>

<p>(Here Mr. Potter paused, finger on lip, to
glance stealthily around.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: If what, Mr. Potter?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: (Drawing near and speaking in hushed
voice) If you be ... set on a-doin’ of it ...
very determined on ... the deed, sir, your best
way is to—hist! A pistol ... no, a musket
... some good dark night. Hist—Potter’s mum!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: You don’t love him, I think?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Love him? Well, there be things ’as
’appened ’ereabouts as no one can’t swear agin
nobody, d’ye see, an’ yet ... old Pen knows
more than she dare speak, I rackon, an’ Potter
ain’t blind nor yet deaf.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: What kind of things?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Well, theer was poor Dick Hobden as
went a-walkin’ one evenin’ Windover way wi’
Lucy Price, a rare handsome lass. Poor Dick
were found stone dead next day, but the lass
vanished an’ nobody never seen her no more, nor
never will, I reckon.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Vanished?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Ay, like Mary Beal as disappeared and
came back and drownded of ’erself, pore lass.
There was Ruth Wicks as likewise vanished an’
was found weeks arterwards singin’ in the dark
atop o’ Windover ... died mad, she did.
There was other lasses as disappeared from Wilmington
an’ Litlin’ton an’ never come back.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: A hateful tale!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: It be, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: And whom do you suspect?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Mum for that, sir! But there be folk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
as Potter would be j’yful to ’ave the skinnin’
of——</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: You mean my Lord Sayle and Sturton——</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: Hist—sir! Speak soft! I don’t mean
nothin’. Only what one bids t’other obeys....
And now Lord Sayle swears he’ll ruin all on us—every
man an’ bye, ah, wumman, maid an’ babe,
not forgettin’ wives an’ widders.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: How so?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Mr. Potter</span>: He’s took an oath to put down “the
trade,” d’ye see. Potter be a inoffensive creater’
as never drawed steel in his life—except mebbe
now and then—I prefers a short bat ... and
never fired a shot in all my days—except p’r’aps
once or twice an’ then only when com-pelled....
Ah, a peaceable man be Potter, but....</p>

</div>

<p>Here Mr. Potter laid finger to lip and looked slantwise
at Sir John beneath lifted eyebrow. And then
old Penelope called them; and, glancing round, Sir
John was amazed to behold her clad in a sumptuous
gown whose voluminous silken folds lent her a strangely
arresting dignity, while upon her snowy hair was a
mob cap marvellously belaced.</p>

<p>“Aye, it be real silk, young man!” quoth she, with
a little shake in her voice. “List to it rustle!”
And sighing ecstatically, she spread out the rich folds
with her gnarled old fingers. “There bean’t a grander
dress nowhere.... Jarge give it me las’ Christmas.
’Tidn’t often I wears it, no ... but when I die, I’ll
be buried in it—won’t I, Jarge?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, Pen!” nodded Mr. Potter. “But,
Lord—’oo’s a-talkin’ o’ dyin’! Be the kittle abilin’?”</p>

<p>“Aye, lad, tea’s ready. As for you, young man,
if you’ll drink wi’ me as they name witch, an’ bean’t
fruttened lest I blast ’ee wi’ a look o’ my eye—come
your ways to tea.”</p>

<p>Following her into the cottage, Sir John beheld yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
other unexpected wonders, as the handleless cups of
exquisite ware, the beautiful Chinese teapot, the tray
of priceless Chinese lacquer.</p>

<p>“Aha, you may stare, young man!” nodded old
Penelope. “There bean’t a lady in arl the land can
show ’ee sech chaney as mine.... Jarge give it tu
me!”</p>

<p>“Why, ye see, sir,” added Mr. Potter apologetically,
“I bean’t married!”</p>

<p>“An’ look at the lace in my cap, young man ...
real French point—arl from Jarge.”</p>

<p>“Why, ye see, sir,” quoth Mr. Potter again, “I
aren’t got no sweet’eart!”</p>

<p>And thus Sir John Dering, sitting between old
Penelope Haryott the witch, and Mr. George Potter
the guileless, drank smuggled tea out of smuggled
china, talked and listened, asked questions and
answered them, and enjoyed it all uncommonly well.</p>

<span class="smaller">DESCRIBES A SCANDALOUS ITEM OF FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE AND THE CONSEQUENCES THEREOF</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“The Barrasdaile” was back in town and all the
beaux of Mayfair were agog, and forthwith
hasted to give her welcome. They came by coach,
in sedan chairs, on horseback and afoot; battered
beaux wise in wine and women, sprightly beaux wise
in town gossip and the latest mode, youthful beaux
wise in nothing as yet; but one and all they gathered
from every point of the compass and clad in all the
colours of the spectrum, passioning for her wealth,
eager for her rank, allured by her youth, or smitten
by her beauty, agreeable to their own respective ages
and conditions; they came to flourish hats gracefully,
shoot ruffles languidly, flutter handkerchiefs daintily,
tap snuff-boxes dreamily, to stare, ogle, smile, frown,
sigh and languish, each according to his nature. And
chief amongst these, my Lord Sayle, more completely
assured of himself than usual, if it were possible; and
this by reason that His Majesty (so gossip had it) was
about to reinstate him in the royal favour and make
him Lord-Lieutenant of his county besides, on condition
that he put down the damnable practice of
smuggling in his neighbourhood. Be this as it may,
it was an indisputable fact (rumour was positive on
this point) that His Majesty had received him, deigned
him a nod, and chattered at him in German, whereupon
other gentlemen immediately bowed to him,
renewed acquaintance and congratulated him in
English. Thus my Lord Sayle found himself in very
excellent spirits.</p>

<p>Now upon the very morning of my Lady Barrasdaile’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
so triumphant return, it befell that <i>The Satyric
Spy, or Polite Monitor</i>, most scandalous and (consequently)
most carefully perused of journals, came out
with the following items of fashionable intelligence:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Lady</span> H——a B——e, whose sudden and
inexplicable desertion so lately made of Mayfair
a dreary waste, hath been seen driving
post for Paris. Paris doubtless awaited her
with yearning expectation, but yearned vainly.
For, upon the highway this bewitching she
(<i>mirabile dictu</i>) vanished utterly away.
Paris received her not, Dieppe knew her not!
Whither she vanished, by what means, to
what end, at what precise minute of the day
or night, or precisely where this astounding
disappearance took place, these be questions
answerable but by her bewitching self.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">But</span></p>

<p class="noindent">It is furthermore credibly reported that Sir
J——n D——g, whose triumphs in the
<span class="smcap">Paphian Fields</span> have made him <span class="smcap">notorious</span>
and the <span class="smcap">envy</span> of lesser humans not so fortunate,
left Paris abruptly two or three days
ago, and hath been observed in company with
a pretty <span class="smcap">serving-maid</span>, a <span class="smcap">buxom waiting-wench</span>
whose humble situation in life is completely
off-set by the potency of her peerless
charms. Sir J——n D——g, quick to recognise
the goddess despite her <span class="smcap">homespun</span>, is
become her very devoted slave and adorer.
It is thought that he may carry her eventually
London-wards to out-rival the unrivalled
<span class="smcap">Barrasdaile</span>.</p>

<p><i>Nota Bene</i>: He that runs may read! Who
seeth through a brick wall cannot be blind.
Yet whoso addeth two and two and maketh
of them five must be a bad arithmetician.

<p>Mayfair was powerfully and profoundly stirred:
elegant gentlemen, having perused these extracts from
<i>The Polite Monitor</i> hurriedly to themselves, forthwith
hasted to read them aloud, and with due deliberation,
to all who would listen; they were the main topic
of discussion in every fashionable club and coffee-house.
Fine ladies, old and young, becked and nodded
over their Bohea, etc., lifted censorious eyebrows,
whispered behind their fans, and, learning my lady
was in town, promptly ordered coach or chair and
were borne incontinent to my lady’s house in St.
James’s Square, each and every armed with a copy
of <i>The Polite Monitor</i>, and all eager to pour oil on
the flames as lovingly as possible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Herminia, Lady Barrasdaile, that
spoiled child of fortune, having sworn at her meek
maid and snubbed her doting Aunt Lucinda into
angry revolt, sat scowling at the reflection of her
beauteous self in the mirror, with this same scandalous
“hateful” journal crumpled in passionate fist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>“O mem,” wailed the faithful Betty, “if you’d
only took my advice——”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, creature!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady! But if you’d only not run
away——”</p>

<p>“Peace, devilish female!”</p>

<p>“Yes, mem! But I told you how ’twould——”</p>

<p>Here my lady launched a hairbrush, whereat Betty
squealed and vanished.</p>

<p>“Thou’rt so wild, Herminia!” exclaimed her
diminutive aunt—“so woefully, wilfully wild! Such
a masterful madcap like thy poor father before
thee!”</p>

<p>“Would he were alive this day to ... cram this
hateful thing down somebody’s throat!” cried my
lady, hurling <i>The Polite Monitor</i> to the floor and
stamping on it.</p>

<p>“Aye, but whose throat, child? ’Tis what all the
world will be asking—whose?”</p>

<p>“Whose, indeed!” repeated my lady between white
teeth. “Let me but find him—let me but be sure!”</p>

<p>“Heavens, Herminia!—and what then?”</p>

<p>“Then, if I could find no better champion, I’d ...
thrash or fight him myself!”</p>

<p>“Cease, child, cease! Remit thy ravings; ’tis
merest madness! Horrors, Herminia, how——”</p>

<p>“O Aunt Lucy, a Gad’s name cease gasping out
alliterations on me—do!”</p>

<p>“Fie, miss! And you with your profane oaths and
vulgar swearing indeed! Look at ye, with your
great, strong body and hugeous powerful limbs! I
protest thou’rt positively——”</p>

<p>“Aunt, dare to call me ‘strapping’ or ‘buxom’
and I’ll set you atop of the armoire yonder!”</p>

<p>“Nothing so feminine, Herminia!” retorted her
very small aunt, with the utmost courage. “Brawny’s
the word! Thou’rt positively brawny, a brawn——”
Here a pantherine leap, a muffled scream, and my
lady’s aunt, clasped in my lady’s arms, was whirled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
to the top of a tall press in adjacent corner, there to
dangle two very small and pretty feet helplessly, to
clutch and cower and whimper to be taken down.</p>

<p>“’Faith, aunt,” quoth my lady, “to see you so,
none would ever believe you were a duchess and so
great a lady.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t feel like one!” wailed the Duchess
miserably. “How can I? O Herminia ... child
... my dear, prithee take me down. If I fall——”</p>

<p>“You won’t fall, dear aunt—you never do!”</p>

<p>“I nearly did last time, minx!”</p>

<p>“Because you wriggled, aunt.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ha’ this hateful thing destroyed!” cried the
Duchess, striking the huge piece of furniture with a
ridiculously small, white hand.</p>

<p>“Then I shall buy a bigger!” quoth my lady.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll leave thee, thou vixenish child!”</p>

<p>“But you’d come back to me, thou dear little loved
aunt.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I should, thou great amiable wretch. Now
pray lift me down like the sweet, gentle soul thou
art, Herminia.”</p>

<p>“Am I brawny, aunt?”</p>

<p>“Thou’rt a fairy elf! Take me down, child.”</p>

<p>“As for fighting, aunt——”</p>

<p>“Thou couldst not, wouldst not, thou’rt too
maidenly, too tender, too gentle ... take me
down!”</p>

<p>“But indeed, aunt, you know I can fence better
than most men—aye, as well as Sir John Dering himself,
I’ll wager.”</p>

<p>“That wretch! Pray lift me down, Herminia,
dear.”</p>

<p>“’Faith, aunt, perched so, you look like a girl o’
fifteen!”</p>

<p>“And I’m woman of forty-five——”</p>

<p>“With scarce a white hair and never a wrinkle!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, child, I can feel ’em growing as I sit here,
so prithee, my sweet love, lift me——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>But at this moment was a hurried knock and Mrs.
Betty entered, cheeks flushed and mild eyes wider
than usual.</p>

<p>“O my lady!” she exclaimed—“Company!”</p>

<p>“Betty,” cried the Duchess, “come and take me
down—this moment!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dessent, your Grace.... O mem, there
be company below ... ladies, mem—crowds, and
gentlemen!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried my lady between clenched teeth,
“so they’re here already—to tear and rend me,
dammem!”</p>

<p>“Herminia!” cried the Duchess, scandalised.
“Herminia, fie! Herminia, for shame! I gasp,
child! Such language, miss——”</p>

<p>“Fits the occasion, aunt, so tush—and hush!
Who’s below, Betty—the women, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, mem, I only got a glimp’, but I ’spied my
Lady Belinda Chalmers for one——”</p>

<p>“That detestable rattle! Who else?”</p>

<p>“My Lady Prudence Bassett was with her, mem.”</p>

<p>“That backbiting vixen! And Mrs. Joyce Mildmay
is with ’em, I’ll vow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mem——”</p>

<p>“’Tis this devilish <i>Monitor</i> hath brought ’em upon
me, and they’re here to condole with me—the
wretches!”</p>

<p>“But I’m with ye, child!” quoth the Duchess from
her lofty perch, whence my lady hasted to lift her
forthwith, holding her suspended in mid-air a moment
to kiss her furiously ere she set her gently down.</p>

<p>“God bless you, aunt, for a sweet, kind little soul!
But I’ll not see ’em—yes, I will, and you shall come
too! Yet no,” sighed my lady, “no, ’twere better
I front their claws alone—the cats. Come you to my
rescue should they inflict themselves on me too long,
dearest.” And having, with Mrs. Betty’s deft aid,
smoothed her silks and laces, having patted and
pulled at rebellious curls, my lady descended the broad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
stair and swept into the great reception-room, where
a group of chattering ladies rose with one accord,
chattering fond epithets, to embrace her, kiss, fondle
and stare at her with eyes that took in for future
reference every item of her apparel, every gesture,
glance and flicker of her eyelash.</p>

<p>“My dearest Herminia, welcome back to town!”
cried Lady Belinda, with a pouncing kiss. “How
vastly well you’re looking ... though a little worn,
of course ... a trifle pale, my love!”</p>

<p>“Pale, indeed!” sighed Lady Prudence, “and small
wonder, my sweet soul, for who would not look pale
and haggard under the circumstances?”</p>

<p>“And such circumstances, Herminia love!” gasped
Mistress Joyce, shuddering and turning up her large
blue eyes soulfully. “To think thy fair, unblemished
name should be even remotely associated with that—that
monster, Sir John Dering! My heart bleeds for
thee, thou poor, injured dear!” At this, every other
lady sighed also and shuddered in unanimous horror,
while the gentlemen scowled, nodded, rapped snuff-boxes
loudly, snuffed ferociously and voiced their
sentiments of indignant abhorrence.</p>

<p>“A dem’d, lying scandal, by heaven!” exclaimed
Lord Verrian.</p>

<p>“A dooced scandalous lie, on my soul!” ejaculated
Mr. Prescott.</p>

<p>“Such infernal, audacious, dem’d impertinence
should not be permitted for a dem’d moment, by
Gad!” quavered fierce old Lord Aldbourne.</p>

<p>“Paper should be publicly burned!” quoth Captain
Armitage.</p>

<p>“And the impudent editor-fellow instantly hanged!”
added my Lord Sayle fiercely, while divers other
gentlemen said much the same and quite as ferociously.</p>

<p>“You are alluding to the report in <i>The Monitor</i>, I
think?” inquired my lady serenely.</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes, my dearest!” answered Lady Belinda
languishing. “To the—the scandalous notice concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
you, my love, and that—that infamous Dering
creature! Needless to say, dear Herminia, we are
all positively sure that ’tis basely false—a most wicked
invention not worthy a moment’s credit, though, to be
sure—you was in France very lately, my sweet soul,
was you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear Herminia,” sighed Lady Prudence,
“and Mr. Scarsdale here assures us that he met and
spoke with Sir John Dering on the road between Dieppe
and Paris! Is it not so, sir?”</p>

<p>“Beyond all question, ladies!” answered Mr.
Scarsdale, stepping forward and bowing with a flourish.
“Not only did I see Sir John, but conversed with
him——”</p>

<p>“Eh—eh?” cried old Lord Aldbourne pettishly,
curving talon-like fingers about his ear. “Eh, sir—cursed
with him, d’ye say? What about, pray?”</p>

<p>“I said ‘conversed,’ my lord,” answered Mr. Scarsdale,
flushing a little.</p>

<p>“Then dammit, sir, speak up, sir!” commanded
his ancient lordship. “Be good enough to remember
that my dem’d ears are not so young as they were!”</p>

<p>“As I was saying,” pursued Mr. Scarsdale, making
the most of the occasion, “I met Sir John Dering by
chance at a wayside inn, not twenty miles from Paris,
and had some conversation with him.”</p>

<p>“Why then, sir,” quoth my lady, “’tis like you saw
this ‘wench,’ this ‘nymph,’ this ‘goddess in homespun’?”</p>

<p>“Egad, my lady,” smirked Mr. Scarsdale, “now you
mention it, I did——”</p>

<p>“Hid?” cried Lord Aldbourne. “What did ye
hide for, sir, and where?”</p>

<p>“My lord, I say that I caught a brief glimpse of Sir
John Dering’s ‘buxom wench’!”</p>

<p>“Oh, rat me, but did ye so, Scarsdale?” piped
Mr. Prescott. “And was she handsome indeed—come?”</p>

<p>“Let me parish, sir, if she wasn’t!” cried Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Scarsdale, ecstatic. “A magnificent crayture, on my
life! A plum, sir, a glorious piece——”</p>

<p>“We believe you, sir!” quoth Captain Armitage.
“Dering ever had an infallible eye, a most exact
judgment!”</p>

<p>“And pray, sir, what was she like?” demanded my
lady, rising and approaching the speaker. “Be very
particular. Was she dark or fair? And her features
... her face, sir, was it round or oval——”</p>

<p>“She was dark, my lady, dark as night!” answered
Mr. Scarsdale. “As to her face ... her face, my
lady....” Here, meeting my lady’s glance, he faltered
suddenly, his eyes opened wider, his heavy mouth
gaped slightly, and he seemed to experience some
difficulty with his breath.</p>

<p>“Well, sir!” demanded my lady. “What was she
like?”</p>

<p>“She was ... very beautiful ... beyond description
...” mumbled Mr. Scarsdale, heedless of
Lord Aldbourne’s vociferous demands that he would
“speak up and be dem’d!”</p>

<p>“Was I there?” questioned my lady relentlessly.</p>

<p>“No, no ... no, indeed, madam.”</p>

<p>“And yet you saw me!” She laughed scornfully
and turned her back upon his pitiable discomfiture.
“For, O dear friends,” she cried, “dear my loving
friends, for once our <i>Monitor</i> doth not lie! Aye,
indeed, ’tis all true—every word on’t. I was the
serving-wench Mr. Scarsdale was so kind to favour
with his notice—’tis all true!”</p>

<p>“Heaven save us!” ejaculated Lady Belinda
faintly, then uttered a stifled scream and closed her
eyes. “I sink!” she gasped. “I swoon! O my
poor Herminia, beware! Think, mem, think what
you are saying! Oh, I am shocked.... ’Tis dreadful!”</p>

<p>But here my lady laughed joyously, while all watched
her in more or less scandalised amaze—all save Mr.
Scarsdale, who was mopping damp brow in corner
remote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>Her merriment subsiding, my lady arose and,
standing before them, proud head aloft, told her
tale.</p>

<p>“Some of you know that I have long entertained
the deepest animosity against Sir John Dering, and
with just cause——”</p>

<p>“We did!” quoth Lady Belinda, tossing her head.</p>

<p>“We do, madam!” answered Captain Armitage
gravely.</p>

<p>“And most of you are, I think, acquainted with
that impetuous boy, Viscount Templemore, who,
inspired by some rash word of mine concerning Sir
John Dering, started for Paris with some wild notion
of becoming my champion and forcing Sir John to
fight him. Hearing of this madness, I set off in
immediate pursuit, but my coach broke down and,
thus delayed, and to while away a dreary hour, I
wrapped myself in my maid’s cloak and walked out
to watch the moon rise, and thus, by the merest chance,
met Sir John himself, who, it seemed, had left Paris
ere the duel could take place. All of you, I think, are
aware of Sir John’s overweening pride and arrogance,
and I determined to make this fortuitous meeting a
means of humbling his pride and trampling his lofty
self-esteem in the dust. Judge now if I have succeeded
or no! Sir John mistook me for a serving-maid,
whereupon I acted the part of shy, country simpleton
to such perfection—Mr. Scarsdale saw me in the part,
you’ll remember, and was equally deceived—were you
not, Mr. Scarsdale?”</p>

<p>But that gentleman had softly and discreetly taken
his departure.</p>

<p>“Well, dear my friends, the end of it was, I very
soon had Sir John sighing and languishing to such
degree that I ran away with him——”</p>

<p>“Madam!” exclaimed Lady Belinda.</p>

<p>“O heavens!” gasped Lady Prudence.</p>

<p>“Until he thought me safe, and then—I ran away
from him—left him, with a flea in his ear, disconsolate—to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
mourn and seek his shy, humble, rustical wench
as he is doubtless doing at this very moment——”</p>

<p>“Tee-hee!” laughed ancient Lord Aldbourne,
slapping feeble knee with veinous hand. “Dering—that
terror o’ husbands! Hee-he! Oh, sink me!
Jilted, bilked and made a dem’d, everlasting fool of
by a serving-wench! Oh, split me!” And my lord
laughed until he choked, and would have rolled to the
floor but for the Captain’s ready arm.</p>

<p>And now, as she turned, my lady found my Lord
Sayle beside her.</p>

<p>“By heaven, madam,” he exclaimed, his assurance
no whit abated, “I protest ’twas marvellous well
done, egad! We entertained an angel unawares;
’twas your divine self that honoured us, after all,
then.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir!” she retorted in fierce scorn, “and
’twas your base self that I scorned then, as I do now—and
ever shall!” And she left him to scowl after
her while the room buzzed with talk and laughter.</p>

<p>“That Dering, of all men, should be so flammed!
O monstrous rich!”</p>

<p>“When this gets round ... alas, poor Sir John!
Ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“Poor Dering ... every coffee-house in town will
ring with the tale!”</p>

<p>“He will never dare show his face in London after
this!” etc. etc., until the long room echoed again.</p>

<p>Then the tall, folding doors were opened almost
unnoticed, and a gorgeous menial solemnly announced:</p>

<p>“Sir John Dering!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW SIR JOHN DERING CAME BACK TO MAYFAIR</span></h2>

</div>

<p>For a moment, it seemed, none spoke or moved;
all faces turned towards the slender, elegant
figure on the threshold, where stood Sir John, his most
exquisite self. Thus he entered amid a strange hush,
a silence broken only by the tap of his high-heeled
shoes; and, aware of the many staring eyes, saw
only those of her who stood drawn to her noble height,
in all the dignity of laces and brocade; and, very
conscious of the latent hostility all about him, advanced
down the long room with a leisured ease, apparently
totally unconscious of all save my lady and his serene
and placid self.</p>

<p>Haughty and unbending she stood to meet him,
with no smile of greeting, no hand to welcome him.
Thus his bow was of the deepest and his voice of the
gentlest when he spoke.</p>

<p>“My Lady Barrasdaile, this is a moment I have
oft dreamed on, and, by my soul, madam, now that I
see you at last, your face and form remind me powerfully
of one whom I found—and have lost awhile!
My lady, behold your most faithful, obedient, grateful
servant!”</p>

<p>For a long moment she viewed him with a vague
disquiet, then, as she thus hesitated, the doors were
thrown wide to admit the diminutive Duchess, very
dignified as became her rank, and mounted upon a
pair of extremely high-heeled shoes; at whose advent
went up a murmur of polite salutation, backs were
dutifully bent, handkerchiefs fluttered, and gowns
billowed to elaborate curtsys; in the midst of which
my lady spoke:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“Dear aunt, you come pat to the occasion as usual!
Permit me to present to you Sir John Dering. Sir
John, the Duchess of Connington!”</p>

<p>A moment of utter stillness—a dramatic moment
wherein noble gentlemen gazed dumbly expectant
and fair ladies thrilled and palpitated in delightful
suspense while the Duchess, that small yet potent
arbiter, scrutinised Sir John in silent appraisement;
at last, smiling, she reached forth her hand.</p>

<p>“Welcome to town, Sir John!” said she as he bowed
low above her very small fingers.</p>

<p>Gentlemen breathed again, ladies fanned themselves
and chattered; the fiat had gone forth: Her Grace
of Connington had received the “dreadful creature,”
who consequently could not be too dreadful for Mayfair.</p>

<p>Thus Sir John was duly presented to ladies who
blushed and simpered, drooped tremulous lashes,
languished soulfully or frowned austerely according to
which best became her particular type of beauty;
and to gentlemen who bowed and protested themselves
his devoted, humble, etc., until he found himself
confronted by one, a fierce-eyed gentleman with one
arm in a sling, this, who surveyed him from head to
foot with an expression of arrogant contempt.</p>

<p>“Sir John Dering, is it,” he demanded, “or Mr.
Derwent—which?”</p>

<p>“You may have your choice, sir,” answered Sir
John pleasantly, “for each of ’em is equally at your
service the moment you feel yourself sufficiently
recovered, my lord!” And Sir John made to pass
on, but Lord Sayle interposed, his air more threatening
than ever. Quoth he:</p>

<p>“Sir John Dering, or Derwent, or whatever name
you happen to be using—last time we met, sir——”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” smiled Sir John amiably, “I advised
your lordship to take fencing lessons——”</p>

<p>“Tee-hee!” screeched old Lord Aldbourne suddenly.
“Hee-ha! Fencing lessons! Oh, smite me!”</p>

<p>Sir John slipped nimbly aside just in time to escape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
my Lord Sayle’s passionate fist; then the two were
borne apart amid an indignant whirl of embroidered
coat-skirts.</p>

<p>“Shame, my lord, shame!” cried half a dozen
voices, while ladies screamed, moaned, grew hysterical,
and made instant preparation to swoon in their most
becoming attitudes.</p>

<p>“O Ged!” screeched Lord Aldbourne above the
hubbub, “I never saw such a dem’d disgraceful
exhibition in all my dem’d life! Sayle, you must be
mad or dem’d drunk, sir ... in a ladies’ drawing-room
full o’ the dear creeters ... oh, dem!” And
then, high-pitched, cold and merciless rose my lady’s
voice.</p>

<p>“My Lord Sayle, pray have the goodness to retire.
Your manners are better suited to your country
taverns. Begone, sir, ere I summon my servants!”</p>

<p>In the awful silence that ensued, my Lord Sayle
stared vaguely about him like one stupefied with
amazement, then, striding to the open door, he stood
striving for coherent speech, and when at last utterance
came, he stammered thickly:</p>

<p>“You ... you shall regret ... bitterly ...
bitterly! Aye, let me perish but you shall!” Then,
flinging up his uninjured arm in passionate menace,
he turned and was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW SIR JOHN DERING WENT A-WOOING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>My Lord Sayle’s abrupt departure sufficed to
break up the assembly; my lords and ladies
having been very delightfully amused, interested,
thrilled and shocked by the varied incidents of the
last crowded hour, hasted to be gone, eager to recapitulate
the whole story (with numerous additions,
to be sure) to the astounded ears of those unfortunates
who had missed so singular an occasion.</p>

<p>Thus, while my lady bade adieu to her guests (each
and all more her doting friends and obedient humble
servants than ever), Sir John presently found himself
alone with the Duchess in a curtained alcove, and
stooping, took her so small hand ere she was aware
to kiss it with such reverence that she actually flushed.</p>

<p>“O heavens, sir!” she exclaimed. “Pray, why
so—so infinite impressive?”</p>

<p>“Madam,” he answered gravely, “despite the evil
that is told of me, with more or less truth, alas, you
were generous! Having the power to abase me, you
mercifully chose to lift me up. Pray believe that my
gratitude is yours, now and ever!”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said she, noting his earnest face, “you
are strangely unlike the Sir John Dering I anticipated.
Your—your reputation, sir——”</p>

<p>“Aye, my reputation!” he repeated wearily.
“’Faith, madam,’tis my incubus that hath me in a
strangle-gripe. For years I have endured it with a
fool’s content, but now when I would be rid on’t I
may not. ’Tis a haunting shadow, a demon mocking
my best endeavours. Evil is naturally expected of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
me, virtue—never. Indeed, you behold in me the
poor victim of a relentless fate——”</p>

<p>“Fate, sir?” cried a scornful voice, and my Lady
Herminia stepped into the alcove.</p>

<p>“Even so, madam!” he answered, rising to bow.</p>

<p>“Heaven preserve us!” she exclaimed. “Do you
dare put the onus of your own misdemeanours upon
Fate?”</p>

<p>“Nay, then,” he answered, “let us call it Fortune,
madame, since Fortune is—feminine, and esteemed
ever a fickle jade!”</p>

<p>“So, sir, having contrived yourself an evil notoriety,
you would turn cynic and rail upon Fate, it seems!”</p>

<p>“Nay, madam, cursed by cruel Fortune, I am become
a Man o’ Sentiment and find in simple things the great
and good content: the carolling bird, the springing
flower, the rippling brook, these have charms the
which——”</p>

<p>“Tush, sir, you grow lyrical, which becometh you
most vilely.”</p>

<p>“Fie, Herminia!” cried the Duchess. “Hold thy
teasing tongue, miss. Sir John is right, indeed—I
myself love to hear the carolling brook—I mean the
rippling bird—— There, see how you ha’ fluttered
me! Sit down, Herminia—do! And you, Sir John!
Be seated—both o’ you, instead of standing to stare
on each other like—like two fond fools foolishly fond!
So! Now, surely, Sir John, a man’s reputation is his
own, to make or mar?”</p>

<p>“Nay, ’faith, your Grace, doth not a man’s reputation
make or mar him, rather? And whence cometh
reputation but of our friends and enemies who judge
us accordingly. So the world knows us but as they
report. Thus, he or she that would be held immaculate
should consort solely with dogs or horses that ha’
not the curse of speech.”</p>

<p>Here my lady sighed wearily and began to tap with
impatient foot.</p>

<p>“Herminia, hush!” exclaimed the Duchess. “Hush<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
and flap not fidgeting foot, miss. How think you of
Sir John’s argument?”</p>

<p>“I think, aunt, that Sir John, according to Sir
John, doth make of Sir John a creature so unjustly
defamed that one might look to see Sir John sprout
wings to waft good Sir John from this so wicked
world. And pray, Sir John, may we ask to what
we owe the unexpected honour of your presence
here?”</p>

<p>“Alas, madam,” he sighed, “to what but matrimony!
I am here in the matter of marriage.”</p>

<p>The Duchess gasped and strove to rise, but her
niece’s compelling hand restrained her.</p>

<p>“Pray, sir, whose marriage?”</p>

<p>“My own, madam. You behold me ready to wed
you how, when and where you will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then,” quavered the Duchess, “oh, pray, sir,
ere you continue—I’ll begone.... Herminia, suffer
me to rise——”</p>

<p>“Nay, dear aunt, rather shall you suffer along with
me——”</p>

<p>“Loose me, love!” implored the Duchess. “Unhand
me, Herminia; I will not remain.... I cannot—so
awkward for Sir John ... for me! Oh, horrors,
Herminia!”</p>

<p>“Horrors indeed, dear aunt, but we’ll bear ’em
together.”</p>

<p>“But—O child! A proposal—and I here! So
indelicate! I’m all of a twitter, I vow!”</p>

<p>“So am I, aunt. So shalt thou sit here with me
and hear Sir John’s comedy out, poor though it be.
And Sir John ever performs better with an audience,
I’ll vow!”</p>

<p>“O sir,” wailed the little Duchess helplessly,
“you see how I’m constrained! Herminia is so—so
strapping and strong! I may not stir, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Aunt!”</p>

<p>“And brutishly brawny, sir.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Lucinda!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Sir John. “A most excellent
phrase, your Grace!” And out came his memorandum
forthwith. “‘Bewitching but brutishly brawny is she!’
Here is metre with an alliterative descriptiveness very
delightfully arresting! And now, mesdames, I am
hither come most solemnly to sue the hand of my
Lady Barrasdaile in marriage——”</p>

<p>“Then,” she retorted angrily, “all things considered,
sir, I demand to know how you dare?”</p>

<p>“Not lightly, madam, believe me,” he answered
gravely; “but matrimony no longer daunts me.
Having made up my mind to’t, I am ready to face it
undismayed, to endure unflinching——”</p>

<p>“Sir, you insult me!”</p>

<p>“Madam, if I do, you are the first and only woman
I have so insulted.”</p>

<p>“Remember the past, sir—its horrors——”</p>

<p>“Think of the future, madam, its joys. As my
wife——”</p>

<p>“Heaven save and deliver me, sir!” she exclaimed
scornfully. “Do you for one moment
imagine I would contemplate a situation so extreme
horrid?”</p>

<p>“But indeed, my lady, despite what the cynics
say, marriage hath much to commend it. More
especially a union ’twixt you and me, our natures being
so extreme the opposite of each other.”</p>

<p>“That, indeed, is true, I thank heaven!” she
nodded.</p>

<p>“Alas, yes, my lady. You being of a somewhat
violent, shall we say—ungovernable temper——”</p>

<p>“Too tragically true!” murmured the Duchess
behind her fan.</p>

<p>“Aunt, pray be silent!”</p>

<p>“The <i>armoire</i>, child!”</p>

<p>“Do not distract me, aunt. Sir, you are an
insolent impertinent!”</p>

<p>“But of a nature serenely calm, madam, to temper
your excessive cholers. Indeed, we are each other’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
opposites, for whiles you are something ungentle, very
headstrong, extreme capricious and vastly vindictive,
I am——”</p>

<p>“Utterly detestable, sir!” she cried indignantly.
“Enough—enough! Good Gad! must I sit and hear
you thus abuse me? Forbid it, heaven! Is it not
enough affliction that my name should be coupled
with yours in the scandalous columns of an infamous
journal?”</p>

<p>“Can you possibly mean <i>The Polite Monitor</i>,
madam?” he sighed.</p>

<p>“What else, sir? And you ha’ read the hateful
thing as a matter of course!”</p>

<p>“No, my lady. I wrote it.”</p>

<p>“You, Sir John!” exclaimed the Duchess.</p>

<p>“You—’twas you?” cried my lady.</p>

<p>“Myself!” quoth Sir John. “’Twas writ in haste
and hath small merit, I fear, and little to commend it,
but such as ’tis——”</p>

<p>“Commend it!” cried my lady. “Commend it!
Oh, this is too much; you are insufferable! Sir John
Dering, you weary me; you may retire!” And magnificently
disdainful, she arose.</p>

<p>Sir John’s bow was Humility manifest.</p>

<p>“Madam,” sighed he, “I am now as ever your
ladyship’s most obedient, humble servant. I go—yet
first o’ your mercy and in justice to myself, pray
tell us when ’twill be?”</p>

<p>“What, sir, in heaven’s name?”</p>

<p>“Our wedding. When will you marry me,
Herminia?”</p>

<p>“Never—oh, never!” she cried passionately. “I
had rather die first!”</p>

<p>“Alas, Herminia, for your so passionate refusal!”
he mourned. “Tush, my lady, for your choice o’
death! And for thy so arrogant, unruly self—fare
thee well. So must I to the country there to seek
my Rose.... O Rose o’ love, my fragrant Rose....
God keep thee, my Lady Herminia, and teach thee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
more of gentleness. Duchess, most generous of women—adieu!”</p>

<p>So saying, Sir John bowed, and, wistful and despondent,
took his departure.</p>

<p>“Aunt,” cried her ladyship, when they were alone,
“in heaven’s name, why did you?”</p>

<p>“Why did I what, miss?”</p>

<p>“Receive that—that—man?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps because he—is a man, Herminia. Perhaps
because he is the man to mould and master you.
Perhaps because of his wistful, wondering, woman’s
eyes. Perhaps because you—wished me to—ha!
Why must ye blush, child, pink as a peony, I vow?”</p>

<span class="smaller">TELLS HOW SIR JOHN WENT “BEAR-BAITING”</span></h2>

</div>

<p>From St. James’s Square Sir John directed his
chair to an address in Mount Street, and was
so fortunate as to meet Captain Armitage stepping
forth to take the air; hereupon they flourished their
hats at each other, bowed, and thereafter stood at gaze.</p>

<p>“Armitage,” quoth Sir John, “time worketh
change and five years is a long time!”</p>

<p>“Dering,” answered the Captain, with his pleasant
smile, “five years shall be as many hours—minutes,
if ye’ll have it so!”</p>

<p>“Tommy!” exclaimed Sir John, and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“Jack!” exclaimed the Captain, and shook it
heartily. “’S life!” cried he. “’S death! Egad!...
’od rat me but this is infinite well, upon my soul it is!
Are ye home for good?”</p>

<p>“I hope so, Tom.” Then, having paid his chairmen,
Sir John slipped a hand within the Captain’s
arm and they walked on together.</p>

<p>“Tom,” said he, gently interrupting his companion’s
joyous reminiscences of their schoolboy
escapades and later follies—“Tommy, art minded for
a little gentle sport?”</p>

<p>“Anything ye will, Jack,” answered the Captain
eagerly, “for, demme, the town’s dead at this hour
... a curst dog-hole, rat me! Say the word and
I’m yours. What’s to do?”</p>

<p>“Bear-baiting, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Hey? Bear-baiting? What the——”</p>

<p>“D’ye happen to know which particular coffee-house
my Lord Sayle affects?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“Eh—Sayle?” repeated the Captain, halting suddenly.
“Sayle, is it? Oh, demme! D’ye mean——”</p>

<p>“My Lord Sayle!” nodded Sir John.</p>

<p>“But ... bear-baiting, Jack? O man, Lord love
ye, ’tis pure to ha’ ye back; the town’s alive again,
or will be, burn me if ’twon’t! Sayle, eh? So soon,
Jack! Egad, ’tis like ye!... Bear-baiting. Oh,
demme!” And the Captain halted again to laugh.</p>

<p>“And which coffee-house, Tom——”</p>

<p>“Why, y’ see, Jack, the fellow’s not dared show his
face in town o’ late in consequence o’ that last ‘affair’
of his with poor young Torwood ... but ... I
remember him at Will’s, last year, aye, and Lockett’s.”</p>

<p>To Will’s coffee-house accordingly they directed
their steps, and here, as luck would have it, found
the unconscious object of their quest.</p>

<p>My Lord Sayle was in a corner of the long room, his
back to the door and surrounded by gentlemen who
sipped their various beverages, snuffed or sucked at
their long, clay pipes, while drawers hovered silently
to and fro, obedient to their commands; thus Sir
John and the Captain entered almost unnoticed, and,
securing an adjacent table, Sir John ordered a bottle
of burgundy.</p>

<p>“Burgundy—O Ged!” demurred the Captain.</p>

<p>“You shan’t drink it, Tom!” murmured Sir John.</p>

<p>My Lord Sayle, as one who had more than once
killed “his man,” and was, moreover, reputed to be
in high favour at court just at present, was assured of
a respectfully attentive audience wheresoever he went.</p>

<p>Behold him, then, the room being oppressively
warm, ensconced beside an open window and seated
between his inseparable companions, Sir Roland
Lingley, slim and pallid, and Major Orme, red and a
little corpulent, and surrounded by divers other fine
gentlemen who listened with more or less languid
interest while he held forth on the heinous crime of
smuggling.</p>

<p>“But, my lord,” ventured a mild gentleman in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Ramillie wig, “surely there are worse sins than
smuggling?”</p>

<p>“Ha, d’ye think so, sir, d’ye think so?” demanded
my lord pettishly. “Then ’tis so much the less to
your credit, sir. Damme, sir, how dare ye think so!
I say smuggling is a damnable crime and shall be put
down with a strong hand, sir! With relentless determination,
and, begad, sir, I’m the man to do it.
I’ll purge Sussex yet ere I’m done, aye—I will so!”</p>

<p>“But, my lord, I—I happen to know something of
Sussex and——”</p>

<p>“And what’s this to me, sir?”</p>

<p>“Only that I understand the traffic is widespread
and the Sussex smugglers are accounted desperate
fellows and very cunning, as——”</p>

<p>“And I tell ye, sir, they are demn’d rogues and may
be desperate as they will, but I’ll break ’em! Aye,
by heaven, I will if I have to call in the soldiery and
shoot ’em down!”</p>

<p>“’Twould be a little arbitrary, sir!” ventured the
mild gentleman again.</p>

<p>“Arbitrary, sir—good! Such ha’ been my methods
all my life and always will be. Have ye any other
observations to offer, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, my lord,” answered the mild gentleman.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll ha’ you know there are others besides
smuggling rascals that I’ll deal with ... others, aye
... just so soon as my arm permits. And my method
with them shall be just as arbitrary and—more to the
point, sir, the point!” And my lord tapped the hilt
of his small-sword.</p>

<p>“Tommy,” exclaimed Sir John at this juncture,
“’tis devilish sour wine, this! The properest place
for’t is—out o’ the window!” And, with a wide-armed,
backward swing he sent the contents of his
glass showering over the flaxen wig, wide shoulders
and broad back of my Lord Sayle.</p>

<p>A gasping oath of angry amazement; a moment of
horrified silence....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“What, have I sprinkled some one, Tom?”
questioned Sir John and, glancing over his shoulder,
he seemed to notice my lord for the first time and
laughed. “Why, ’tis no matter, Tom,” quoth he
lightly, “’twas only that fellow Sayle. Shall we try
another bottle?”</p>

<p>My Lord Sayle’s chair was hurled aside, and he
turned to leap at the speaker, but recoiled before the
thrust of a gold-mounted cane.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Sir John, stabbing him off, “since no
ladies are present you ha’ my permission to swear until
you weary, but you will do it at a distance—remain
where you are—sir!”</p>

<p>My lord promptly cursed and swore until he had
raved himself breathless.</p>

<p>“Tut, sir, tut-tut!” smiled Sir John. “Don’t
bluster from the coward’s castle of an injured arm;
come to me when you can mishandle your sword and
I’ll send you back to bed again.... I think we’ll
make it your right leg next time——”</p>

<p>At this, my lord’s frenzy broke forth anew, a wild
torrent of oaths, vituperations and murderous threats,
while Sir John, holding him off with his cane, watched
him with a serene satisfaction until once again my
lord was constrained to pause for breath; whereupon
Sir John continued:</p>

<p>“Give me leave to tell you, my Lord Sayle, that I
account you a thing begotten in evil hour merely to
cast a shadow i’ the sun ... hold off, my lord! ...
and esteem you of no more account. At the same
time, I seize this occasion to state publicly ... pray,
keep your distance, my lord! ... that I, John
Dering, being a man o’ sentiment and also of action,
do solemnly pledge myself to harass you on every
available occasion until I either ha’ the happiness of
driving you out o’ the country or the misfortune to
kill you.”</p>

<p>Here my lord, becoming articulate again, roared
and shouted for his sword, vowing he would fight left-handed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
But now, despite the mad and terrible fury
that shook him and the fell purpose that glared in
his eyes as he raved thus, threatening death and
damnation, clutching vainly at Sir John’s elusive
cane and stamping in baffled rage, the contrast was
so ludicrous that some one tittered nervously and
then came laughter—an hysterical roaring, peal on
peal, that nothing might check or subdue. Even the
mild gentleman had caught the contagion and
laughed until his Ramillie wig was all askew and
himself doubled up, groaning in helpless mirth.</p>

<p>Even when my Lord Sayle, reeling like a drunken
man, was half led, half carried out by his friends, the
company rocked and howled, hooted and groaned,
slapped themselves and each other, wailing in faint,
cracked voices: thus their Gargantuan laughter
waxed and grew until came the drawers to peep and
gape; until pedestrians in the street below paused
to stare and wonder.</p>

<p>“O Jack ... O Jack!” wailed Captain Armitage.
“Hold me ... hit me, a mercy’s name.... Sayle
... vowing to ha’ y’r blood and ... clutching at a
cane that ... wasn’t there!... Swearing hell and
fury and dancing ... like a ... dem’d marionette!
O Lord! ‘Begotten to be a shadow,’ says you!...
‘We’ll make it your ... right leg ... next time!’
Oh, rat me, Jack!...”</p>

<p>“By heaven,” gasped the mild gentleman, “here’s
a tale! Every coffee-house will be ... cackling
with’t. My lord’s loved none too well ... first on
one leg, then ... on t’other....”</p>

<p>Presently, taking advantage of the general uproar,
Sir John hasted to retire, followed by the Captain,
still breathless but eager.</p>

<p>“Ha’ ye any other bears to bait, Jack?” he inquired
as they descended to the street.</p>

<p>“Not at present, Tom.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse,” the Captain sighed. “Howbeit,
I’ll not part with thee; we’ll see the night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
out together. First, dinner at the Piazza, and
then——”</p>

<p>“Thank’ee no, Tom! I’ve affairs——”</p>

<p>“Aha—is she very fair?”</p>

<p>“I’m a man o’ business, Tom, and am in town for
but a short time.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, where are ye living, Jack?”</p>

<p>“At High Dering.”</p>

<p>“Good Ged—the country!” exclaimed Captain
Armitage, visibly shocked. “And y’ are going back
again to rusticate—you, of all men!”</p>

<p>“Immediately.”</p>

<p>“Cabbages and mangold-wurzels!” murmured the
Captain. “Amazing! Unless—aha, some rustic
nymph, perchance—some village Venus, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Nay, Tom, smugglers and an ancient witch, rather.
But what do you do these days?”</p>

<p>“Naught i’ the world since I inherited save play
the fool generally and make love to ‘the Barrasdaile,’
as the fashion is. And——”</p>

<p>“Sounds lamentably dreary, Tom.”</p>

<p>“It is, Jack, it is!” sighed the Captain. “One
wearies of everything, and ‘the Barrasdaile’ hath no
heart! And, talking of her, she flammed and tricked
thee finely, it seems!”</p>

<p>“She did, Tom. You’ve heard the tale, then?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Jack, who hasn’t? ’Twill be all over town
by this, i’ faith, but your ears should tingle, for ’twas
demnably against you! Disguised, Jack ... dressed
in her woman’s clothes and you all unsuspecting,
ha-ha!”</p>

<p>“And ’twas she told you, was it?”</p>

<p>“Herself, Jack, this afternoon just before you made
your dem’d dramatic appearance. And, rat me, but
’twas pure! She had us all roaring with laughter at
thy expense, old lad ... demme, even the women
forgot to be scandalised. To ha’ flammed you of all
men! She must ha’ played the country innocent
marvellous well!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“She must indeed, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Ye see, Jack, she never forgives——”</p>

<p>“A bad habit, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Aye!” nodded the Captain. “And ’tis plain to
see she hates thee—even yet!”</p>

<p>“And that is worse!” sighed Sir John.</p>

<p>“And she’s dev’lish clever and quick—for all her
size. Aye, a passionate creeter ... a goddess ...
all fire, Jack, or freezing cold ... she’ll never”—here
the Captain sighed heavily—“no, she’ll never
marry me, ’tis sure—although——”</p>

<p>“Never, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Oh, begad!” exclaimed the Captain, startled.
“Sink me, but ye seem dem’d sure about it!”</p>

<p>“Tommy, I am!”</p>

<p>“And why, pray?”</p>

<p>“Because if she ever marries any one, that one will
be me.”</p>

<p>“You—you, Jack! You of all men?” stammered
the Captain.</p>

<p>“Myself!”</p>

<p>“Good Ged!” gasped the Captain. “But——”</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” quoth Sir John, and, seizing his
companion’s hand, he shook it heartily and went his
airy way, leaving the Captain to stare after him quite
dumbfounded.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW SIR JOHN PLEDGED HIS WORD: WITH SOME DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTIES OF SNUFF</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The ancient town of Lewes was a-throng, its
High Street full of cheery bustle. Here were
squires and gentry in lace and velvet, farmers and
yeomen in broadcloth and homespun, drovers and
shepherds in smock-frocks and leggings; spurs jingled,
whips cracked, staves and crooks wagged and
flourished in salutation; horsemen and pedestrians
jostled one another good-naturedly, exchanging news
or shouting jovial greetings; wains and waggons
creaked and rumbled, wheels rattled and hoofs
stamped, a blithe riot of sounds, for it was market-day.</p>

<p>Now presently, down the hill from London, past
the ancient church of St. Mary Westout, drove an
elegant travelling-carriage, its panels resplendent with
an escutcheon well known hereabouts, for, beholding
it, all folk, both gentle and peasant, hasted to make
way; so the blood-horses were reined up and the
great chariot came to a stand before the portals of
the ‘White Hart’ inn, whereupon it was surrounded by
a crowd eager for sight of the grand personage whose
rank and fame lifted him so high above the vulgar
herd.</p>

<p>My Lord Sayle, being in a very black and evil
humour, paid scant heed to the shy and somewhat
perfunctory greeting accorded him by the spectators,
but strode into the inn without deigning a glance right
or left.</p>

<p>Forth hasted the bowing landlord to usher his
distinguished guest to the best chamber; and my lord,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
scowling and mumchance, was about to mount the
wide stairway when a young gentleman, descending
in somewhat of a hurry, had the misfortune to jostle
my Lord Sayle’s wounded arm, and was murmuring an
apology when my lord interrupted him with a roar
that, almost immediately, made them the centre of
a curious, gaping crowd, the which served but to inflame
my lord the more, and he raged until the place echoed
of him.</p>

<p>“Damn ye, sir,” he ended, “if ye were a man
instead of a whey-faced lad I’d give myself the joy of
killing ye at the earliest moment!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” retorted the unfortunate young gentleman,
becoming paler still, “I venture to regard myself as
a man, none the less——”</p>

<p>“Ha, do ye, sir—do ye, indeed?” sneered my lord.
“Tell him who I am, somebody!” This information
being eagerly accorded, the young gentleman appeared
to quail, and was about to speak when down the stair
sped a young and beautiful woman.</p>

<p>“Jasper—O Jasper!” she cried; then, facing the
company wide-eyed and pallid with terror, “Gentlemen,”
she pleaded, “my Jasper meant no offence—none,
indeed——”</p>

<p>“Then let him make suitable apology!” quoth my
lord grimly.</p>

<p>“You hear, Jasper—you hear?”</p>

<p>“My lord,” said the pale young gentleman, his lips
painfully a-tremble, “I’ll see you damned first!”</p>

<p>At this the lady screamed, the company murmured
and my lord scowled.</p>

<p>“Sir,” quoth he, “have the goodness to send your
card to me upstairs! In three weeks or a month, I
shall call you to account for your ill-mannered temerity—and
your blood be on your own head!” So saying,
my Lord Sayle strode up the stair, leaving the unfortunate
young gentleman to support his half-swooning
companion into an adjacent chamber amid the sympathetic
murmurs of the company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>It was now that a second carriage drew up before
the inn, an extremely dusty vehicle this, and so very
plain as to excite no more notice than did the slender,
soberly clad person who lightly descended therefrom,
a very ordinary-looking person indeed, except perhaps
for a certain arrogant tilt of the chin and the brilliance
of his long-lashed eyes.</p>

<p>Scarce had his foot touched pavement than he was
greeted by a tall, square-shouldered man, extremely
neat and precise as to attire, who escorted him forthwith
into the inn.</p>

<p>“Well, Robert,” said Sir John—or rather, Mr.
Derwent—when they had found a corner sufficiently
sequestered, “I rejoice to be back; these few days of
town ha’ sufficed. To your true man o’ sentiment,
Rusticity hath a thousand charms, Bob. You agree,
I think?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p>“Old Mr. Dumbrell, for instance. He is well, I
trust, Robert, and——”</p>

<p>“They are, your honour!”</p>

<p>“And how go matters at High Dering?”</p>

<p>“Fairly quiet, sir.”</p>

<p>“You have persevered in the harassing tactics I
suggested in regard to our Mr. Sturton?”</p>

<p>“With the utmost per-sistence, sir.”</p>

<p>“You quite understand that I—ha! I hear a
woman weeping, surely?”</p>

<p>“Chamber in your rear, sir, door on your right,”
answered Robert the Imperturbable; and he briefly
recounted the incident of the unfortunate young
gentleman.</p>

<p>“Perfect!” sighed Sir John. “Not vainly have I
driven these weary miles in my Lord Sayle’s dust.
Let us relieve the lady’s anxiety at once, Robert!”
With a gentle, perfunctory rap, Sir John opened the
door in question and beheld the unfortunate young
gentleman on his knees beside the settle, striving vainly
to comfort her who lay there in tearful misery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“If he kills thee, Jasper—if he should kill thee!”
she sobbed.</p>

<p>“Nay, dearest—beloved, he may not be so terrible
as they say ... he may but wound me——” Here
the young gentleman sprang to his feet as Sir John
spoke.</p>

<p>“Pray, forgive this intrusion, but I come to quell
this lady’s apprehensions, to bid her weep no more.
For, sir, you cannot possibly fight my Lord Sayle——”</p>

<p>“But, sir—sir,” stammered the pale young gentleman,
“I ... it seems I must. I have already
accepted——”</p>

<p>“No matter, sir,” answered Sir John. “You
cannot possibly cross steel with my Lord Sayle until
I have had that pleasure, since mine is the prior claim,
as I will instantly make apparent if you will trouble
to step upstairs with me.”</p>

<p>“But, sir ... I ... I don’t understand,” murmured
the young gentleman. “Pray, whom have I
the honour to address?”</p>

<p>“My name is Dering, sir, John Dering—at your
service.”</p>

<p>“Dering!” exclaimed the young gentleman. “Sir
John Dering of Dering?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the lady, clasping trembling hands.
“The duellist?”</p>

<p>Sir John bowed.</p>

<p>“And my name is Markham, sir——”</p>

<p>“Why, then, Mr. Markham, if you will accompany
me upstairs——”</p>

<p>“Willingly, sir,” answered Mr. Markham.</p>

<p>“O Jasper!” cried the lady. “He ... you are
not going to—fight?”</p>

<p>“No, no, dearest!”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Sir John in his gentlest voice, “I
pledge my word this gentleman shall not fight my
Lord Sayle now or at any other time——”</p>

<p>“You—oh, you are sure, sir?”</p>

<p>“Upon my soul and honour, madam!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>“Then go, Jasper, if you must. But be not long
or I shall swoon or run mad!”</p>

<p>“She ... my wife is ... is not ... very strong,
sir,” stammered the young gentleman as they ascended
the broad stair with the imperturbable Robert at their
heels.</p>

<p>“And so very young, sir!” said Sir John sympathetically.</p>

<p>My Lord Sayle was at wine, supported by his two
companions, Sir Roland Lingley and Major Orme,
and surrounded by young bloods and country beaux
who hearkened to his dicta eagerly and viewed with
eyes of awesome envy this man who had flashed his
terrible steel so often. My lord, used to such hero-worship,
condescended to unbend, and was animadverting
for their behoof upon the delicate point as to
how and when and why to take up a quarrel, when he
became aware of a stir at the door, of a quick, light
footstep, of a holly-stick that with sudden, graceful
twirl swept decanter and glasses crashing to the floor
in splintered ruin, of a face delicately pale and lighted
by a pair of long-lashed eyes that glared down at him,
and of Sir John Dering’s high-pitched, drawling, hated
voice:</p>

<p>“If there is any one present who feels himself in the
very least affronted, I shall be most happy to accommodate
him on the spot!” And, dropping the holly-stick,
Sir John drew sword, before whose glitter the
company drew back as one man.</p>

<p>“And who the devil might you be?” demanded
a voice.</p>

<p>“My name, sirs, is John Dering, and I am here to
tell Mr. Markham in your presence that he cannot
fight my Lord Sayle since I have the prior claim, a
claim I will forgo to no man breathing. I am here
also to tell you, gentlemen of Sussex, that I stand
solemnly pledged to drive my Lord Sayle out o’ the
country or eventually kill him—whichsoever he desire,
for——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>Here my Lord Sayle, who had remained like one
entranced, staring up into the fiercely scornful eyes
above him, succeeded in breaking the spell at last,
and, roaring a savage curse, picked up the first thing
to hand, which happened to be a snuff-box, and
hurled it at his tormentor. But Sir John, ever
watchful, avoided the missile, which, striking an
inoffensive gentleman on the head, deluged him and
those adjacent with snuff, a choking, blinding shower.</p>

<p>Hereupon, clapping perfumed handkerchief to
nostrils, Sir John took up the holly-stick, slipped his
hand within Mr. Markham’s arm and sped from the
room, leaving wild tumult and uproar behind.</p>

<p>Upon the landing, while he paused to sheathe his
sword, the imperturbable Robert took occasion to
transfer the door-key from inside to out, and having
locked the gasping, groaning, cursing sufferers securely
in, followed his master downstairs.</p>

<p>“Sir, how——” gasped Mr. Markham between his
sneezes. “Sir John, how may I ... a-tish ...
express my depths of—gratitude?”</p>

<p>“By hastening back to her who will be growing
anxious for you, sir——”</p>

<p>“Aye, I will—I will, sir!” cried Mr. Markham.
“You see, sir, she ... I ... we are hoping ...
expecting ... a-tisha! ... d’you understand, Sir
John?”</p>

<p>“And give ye joy o’ the event, Mr. Markham. My
heartiest congratulations and best ... asha!” Here
Sir John sneezed violently in turn. “My best—aho—wishes
for you and her and—it, sir!”</p>

<p>“Sir John,” quoth Mr. Markham, grasping his hand,
“should it be ... a-tish! ... a boy, sir, one of his
names, if you’ll permit, shall be ... a-hoosh! ...
John, sir!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Markham, I ... I feel myself extreme ...
shassho ... honoured, sir. My felicitations to your
lady, and good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Robert,” quoth Sir John, when his sneezing had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
somewhat abated, “they seem to be making a confounded
disturbance upstairs! What’s that hammering,
I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen a-trying to get out, I opine, sir!”</p>

<p>“To get out, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Precisely, sir. You see, I happened to lock ’em
in, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you, egad? Then we’d best be off and
away before they break out. Are the horses ready?”</p>

<p>“All ready, sir—this way!”</p>

<p>So presently, having mounted in the yard, they
rode off along the busy street and, winning clear of
the traffic, set spurs to their spirited animals and had
soon left the historic town of Lewes behind them.
Yet often Sir John must turn to view this ancient
town, seeming to drowse in the afternoon’s heat, its
many-hued roofs of tile and thatch topped here and
there by grey church spires; and over all the castle,
with its embattled walls and towers, its mighty keep
rising in grim majesty, hoary with age but glorious
in decay.</p>

<span class="smaller">OF GEORGE POTTER, HIS WHISTLE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“Regarding Mr. Sturton,” said Sir John,
reining his horse to a walk when the old
town had sunk from view behind them, “you perfectly
understand, Robert, that I wish to give him
sufficient rope to very thoroughly hang himself?”</p>

<p>“Pre-cisely, sir!”</p>

<p>“He hath no suspicions as yet of our identity?”</p>

<p>“None whatever, sir.”</p>

<p>“’Tis pity I declared my name at the inn yonder,
Robert.”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t see, sir, how Mr. Sturton is going to
find out as you’re Sir John Dering—I mean, that Mr.
Derwent is Sir John Dering, or that Sir John Dering
is Mr. Derwent, or that your honour is ekally both and
each other, the very same i-dentical person both
together at the very same, pre-cise moment, sir.”</p>

<p>“It certainly sounds sufficiently involved, Bob.
But I will confess the man puzzles me. I have even
troubled to go through his accounts with my lawyers
and they seem perfectly in order—and yet I know
him for a rogue ... and, moreover, he knocked me
into a ditch and called me a ‘lad’!”</p>

<p>“Lorramity!” exclaimed Robert, his imperturbability
momentarily shaken.</p>

<p>“The term ‘lad’ rankles, Bob: the ditch I heartily
forgive him, but—‘lad’!”</p>

<p>“The ex-pression, sir, so applied strikes me as
blass-phemious, your honour!” Sir John laughed
and became thoughtful, seeing which Robert reined
his horse respectfully to the rear, and so they rode on
for a while in silence, then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“Robert!”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“Have you seen Sir Hector recently?”</p>

<p>“Day afore yesterday, sir.”</p>

<p>“How was he?”</p>

<p>“Doleful, sir. ‘Doleful’ is the only word for it!
And, sir, he said a thing which, begging his pardon,
I felt bound to deny.”</p>

<p>“What was it, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Sir, he sets staring at his horses y-ears, being
mounted, sir, and, ‘Robbie,’ says he, and remarkable
bitter, sir, ‘Robbie, women are the devil!’ Whereupon,
sir, I made so bold as to answer, ‘Saving your
presence, Sir Hector—some!’”</p>

<p>“Highly discriminating, Bob!” said Sir John.
“Anything more?”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir, he did. ‘Robbie,’ says he, ‘women ha’
made fools o’ men from the beginning!’ says he, ‘and
so they will to the end! A plague on ’em!’ says he,
and spurs off at a gallop afore I could make retort
ade-quate, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” murmured Sir John pensively. “As to
our Mr. Sturton, have you felt yourself impelled to
any further acts of—hostility, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Only very slightly, your honour. To be particular,
the day afore yesterday, precise time three-thirty-five
p.m., chancing to observe certain young female
in——”</p>

<p>“Damsel, Robert!”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour ... in tears, sir, I stepped
alongside of said young fe——”</p>

<p>“Maid, Robert!”</p>

<p>“Exactly, sir ... and surprised Mr. S. addressing
old Mr. Dumbrell with extreme vin-dictiveness, your
honour, and old Mr. Dumbrell’s hat in a puddle, sir.
Whereupon, felt it urgent to wipe Mr. S.’s face with
said hat, and so the action ended, sir. But, same
evening, being approximately fifteen or, say, twelve
minutes to nine o’ the clock, observing Mr. S. berating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
old Dame Haryott in fashion out-rageous, felt called
upon to re-monstrate with said Mr. S., who, there and
then, sir, did call up two fellows, very tough customers
indeed, and ordered ’em to set about me, which they
immediately did. Being thus outnumbered three to
one, sir, attacked on both flanks and centre, I posted
my rear agin a wall and was preparing to maintain
position to extremity when, at critical moment,
received reinforcements in shape of a man by name
Potter, who played a small bludgeon most determined
and with so nice a dexterity as ’twas a pleasure to
witness, with the happy result, sir, that the enemy
drew off, leaving us masters o’ the field, your honour,
which happened to be Dame Haryott’s front garden.”</p>

<p>“And what, Bob—what do you think of Mr.
Potter?”</p>

<p>“That he’s one as takes a deal o’ knowing, sir.
But, your honour, he happened to tell me a thing as
set me wondering. He told me that Mr. S. walks over
to ‘The Black Horse’ at Wilmington very frequent,
and there meets or con-sorts with Christopher Oxham,
Lord Sayle’s bailiff.”</p>

<p>“Well, Robert?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I determined to follow Mr. S. ... which
I did ... on-perceived, and got sight o’ this Oxham,
a big chap, very bold and loud-voiced. They seemed
to have a deal to say, and, as they parted, Oxham says:
‘My lord returns this week and the lads are all ready,
so at word from you we’ll act!’”</p>

<p>“At word from Sturton!” repeated Sir John, and
rode awhile musing.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Robert, at last, “begging your pardon,
but do you happen to believe in ghosts, spectres,
phantoms and such-like apparitions?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, Bob; I can’t say that I do. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought I didn’t, sir, but that night I—saw
one ... aye, manifest, your honour!”</p>

<p>“How?” questioned Sir John, glancing up sharply.
“You actually saw a ghost, Bob?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“‘Actually’ is the word, sir. All I know is, that I
saw something leaning over Wilmington Churchyard
wall ... a thing, your honour ... as I don’t want
to see again!”</p>

<p>“What sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, ’tis hard to tell ... and the light was
bad ... but it looked about eight foot high and had
a pair o’ horns a yard wide and more ... tipped
wi’ fire! Aye, sir, I know it sounds outrageous, but
it looked worse than it sounds! Mr. S. see it too ...
he was walking p’r’aps a dozen yards or so in my front
and me creeping in his rear ... and suddenly he
gives a kind o’ groan and dropped to his knees, then
scrambles to his feet and away he goes at a run, gasping
and groaning ’till he was out o’ sight.”</p>

<p>“And what did you, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, chancing to have a pistol handy, I let
fly ... but though I’ll swear my bullet took it clean
through the head ... it didn’t do no good, sir, not
a bit—quite the re-verse, your honour; the thing got
up and danced at me, sir ... aye, jigged it did—Lord!”</p>

<p>“And then, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Why, then, sir, I took to my heels and bolted,
ah—a sight faster than Mr. S.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” quoth Sir John. “I don’t think you
should have fired, Bob.”</p>

<p>“No, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, you might have injured it! Besides, ghosts
are supposed to be impervious to bullets, I believe.
And the thing had horns, you say?”</p>

<p>“Sir, I’ll lay my oath on its horns ... ah, and
fiery horns at that! And there’s others have seen it
too, before me.”</p>

<p>“Who, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s Peter Bunkle for one, sir, as keeps
‘The Market Cross Inn’ over at Alfriston; there’s
Mr. Levitt, and Tom Burgess and others besides....
There’s not a man of ’em dare stir out after dark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder!” murmured Sir John musingly. “I
wonder!”</p>

<p>“You believe me, sir, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Implicitly, Bob! I do but cast about for a reasonable
explanation.” And here fell silence again save
for the plodding hoof-strokes of their horses, and an
occasional gusty sigh from the ex-corporal, who, it
seemed, was also busied with his thoughts. It was
after a somewhat louder sigh than usual that Sir John
addressed him suddenly: “How old are ye, Bob?”</p>

<p>“My age, sir,” answered Robert gloomily, “is
forty-five, your honour.”</p>

<p>“I remember you were a boy when you marched to
the wars with my father and Sir Hector.”</p>

<p>“Drummer in Sir Hector’s regiment, sir.”</p>

<p>“And a corporal when he bought you out. You
ha’ been with me a good many years now, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-two, sir ... ever since you was a very
small boy ... a lifetime! And during said time,
your honour has treated me more like a ... a friend,
sir, than a servant. Consequently I am to-day more
your honour’s servant than ever. And I’m ...
forty-five, sir!”</p>

<p>“What o’ that, Bob? So were you months ago,
but it didn’t seem to grieve you then.”</p>

<p>“Why, d’ye see, sir, the years march on a man at
the double, but he never heeds until one day he wakes
up to find as he is ... forty-five!”</p>

<p>“And her name is Ann!” quoth Sir John.</p>

<p>Here, once again, the ex-corporal’s immutable calm
was gravely threatened; he flushed from shaven chin
to neat wig, he blinked and swallowed hard, but when
he answered his voice was as steady and unemotional
as ever:</p>

<p>“Cor-rect, sir!”</p>

<p>“I’m monstrous glad to hear it, Bob. She hath a
slender ankle, a low voice, and is, I hazard, as good
as she looks! ’Tis high time you thought o’ marrying.”</p>

<p>At this the ex-corporal stared hard at his horse’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
ears, from these to the hedges, right and left; finally
he spoke:</p>

<p>“Saving your presence, sir, ’tis not to be thought
of—not for a moment, your honour. Said young
person being scarce turned of twenty years and consequently
out o’ the question——”</p>

<p>“Have you mentioned the question to her, Bob?”</p>

<p>“No, sir! Nor intend so to do ... ’twouldn’t
be ... be ... ’twouldn’t ... well—’twouldn’t,
sir!”</p>

<p>“Still, I wonder what she would think?”</p>

<p>“Aye, your honour, so do I—vastly! But I don’t
know ... never shall know, so—can’t say, sir.”</p>

<p>Here they fell silent once more, and presently, rounding
a bend in the road, the glory of the Downs burst
upon them; range upon range of noble hills whose
smooth slopes and gentle undulations have in them
something sublimely restful, something suggestive of
that beneficent quietude, that reposeful, kindly
silence which is infinitely greater and better than
any speech.</p>

<p>Sir John, having paused awhile to behold this, now
set his animal to a trot, when he heard a rattle of
wheels behind him and a piping, querulous voice
raised in loud complaint:</p>

<p>“Hi—theer! Hey! Caan’t ’ee see as oi be a-comin’
so faast as oi may? Boide a bit, boide for oi,
young man, ’tidn’t neighbourly t’ roide awaay an’
never a word fur nobody nor no one!” And, glancing
round, Sir John espied Mr. Dumbrell, that ancient
person, perched in a light cart beside Mr. Potter, who
drove a very likely-looking horse.</p>

<p>“How are you, Mr. Dumbrell? And you, Potter?”
inquired Sir John as they came up.</p>

<p>“Middlin’ bad, I be!” answered the Ancient One.
“Oi be generally-allus ailin’, oi be! What wi’ that
theer ol’ bullet in my innards, an’ my chacketin’ an’
barkin’, an’ me granddarter, an’ the axey—’tis gurt
wonder as oi doan’t vade an’ wither into my grave,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
that it be! An’ to-day I be mighty cuss an’ cluck
arl-through-along-on-account-of ’im a-comin’ back!
Means trouble ’e du—dannel ’im, oi sez!”</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean?”</p>

<p>“’Oo should oi mean ’cept ’im! Soon’sever ’e
comes, along comes trouble, so dannel ’e twoice, I sez.”</p>

<p>“Gaffer do mean Lord Sayle, sir,” explained Mr.
Potter.</p>

<p>“Aye, ’im!” nodded the Ancient One fiercely. “I
seen ’im, I did, lookin’ so black an’ gloomy-glum! ’E
be a man as bean’t no account no’ow at arl, as I’d up
an’ tell ’un to ’is ’ead, I would! Ah, an’ t’other ’un’s
as bad.”</p>

<p>“Who is t’other one?”</p>

<p>“’Oo? Why, ’im fur sure! ’Im as bean’t nohow
s’good as ’is feäther was afore ’im—that’s ’oo, young
man.”</p>

<p>“’E do mean Sir John Dering, sir,” explained Mr.
Potter again.</p>

<p>“Ah!” snarled the Ancient One, shaking bony fist.
“They be both on ’em come back again to plague the
country an’ the loikes o’ we!”</p>

<p>“Did you happen to see Sir John Dering, Potter?”
inquired Sir John.</p>

<p>“No, sir, but they say ’e’s back in Sussex at last.”</p>

<p>“An’ ’ardly a mile awaay be ‘The Acorn’!” added
the Ancient One; “an’ Ed’ard an’ ’is mistus’ brews
good ale! An’ I be that tur’ble dry. What wi’ me
a-chacketin’ an’ Old Johnny a-tormentin’ o’ me!”</p>

<p>“Old Johnny?” inquired Sir John.</p>

<p>“Gaffer means the axey, sir,” quoth Mr. Potter.</p>

<p>“And pray what is the axey?”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell ’im, Jarge!” snarled Mr. Dumbrell.
“’E mus’ be a barn fule.”</p>

<p>“’Tis the ager, sir,” explained the patient Potter.</p>

<p>“Is your ague indeed so bad, Mr. Dumbrell?”</p>

<p>“Bad?” screeched the old man—“worse’n bad it
be, ah, a sight worse! Nobody never ’ad it so worse
as oi, nowhen! Shook arl to liddle bits oi be——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>“Why, then, let us haste to ‘The Acorn’ forthwith.”</p>

<p>Thither they repaired in company, and found it to
be a small, yet cheery-looking hedge-tavern set at a
bend of the tree-shaded road and presided over by a
large and cheery man remarkable for the width of
his smile and a pair of huge, hairy arms; a man who
greeted them cheerily and at whom Mr. Potter, in the
act of aiding the Ancient One to earth, cocked an
eyebrow and lightly caressed his left whisker; whereupon
the cheery landlord nodded.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, Jarge!” quoth he. “Same time, I
reckon?”</p>

<p>“Near as mebbe, Ed’ard!” nodded Mr. Potter.</p>

<p>“Wind doo sou’-westerly, Jarge?”</p>

<p>“It be, Ben!” answered Mr. Potter, as they
followed the cheery man into a sunny, sand-strewn
tap.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dumbrell,” said Sir John, “having regard to
your ague, may I suggest——”</p>

<p>“Ale!” snapped that Ancient Person. “I never
drinks naum but ale, young man, ’cept, p’r’aps a mug
o’ gumboo now an’ then when ’tis to be ’ad, but no
sperrits for oi!”</p>

<p>The cheery Ed’ard, having attended duly to their
several wants, forthwith returned to smile at the road
again.</p>

<p>“Talking of spirits,” said Sir John as they sat, all
four, with their foaming tankards before them, “ex-Corporal
Robert Doubleday here tells me that he saw
a ghost the other night——”</p>

<p>“Well, what o’ that?” piped the Ancient One.
“Theer be ’ostesses o’ ghostesses ’ereabouts in Sussex,
I rackon. What the rabbits, young man! I du tell
’ee as I’ve seed ghostesses galore, wi’ corpse-candles,
an’ willy-wipsies, aye, an’ fairieses afore noo! Wait
till I’ve blowed the fob off’n my ale, an’ I’ll tell ’ee.”</p>

<p>“Fairieses?” questioned Sir John.</p>

<p>“Some folk do call ’em fairies, sir,” explained Mr.
Potter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, young man,” cried Mr. Dumbrell, wiping his
mouth, “fairieses—liddle bits o’ creeters bigger’n a
squrrel an’ not so gurt as Mus’ Reynolds——”</p>

<p>“’E means a fox, sir,” quoth the explanatory
Potter, observing Sir John’s puzzled look.</p>

<p>“’Old y’r tongue, Jarge, du!” snarled the old man.
“Keep y’r mouth shet, Jarge, an’ gi’e me a chanct to
spik, will ’ee? I be a bit oldish, mebbe, but I bean’t
nowise doddlish!”</p>

<p>“Not you, Gaffer, not you!” answered Mr. Potter
soothingly.</p>

<p>“Well, then, young man,” continued Mr. Dumbrell,
“dappen ye sh’uld be a-walkin’ along-about the four-wents,
Wilmington way, arter dark, you’d see the
ghost o’ pore Tom Stickley as were shot ’longside o’
me whiles we was landin’ tubs over tu Cuckmere ’aven,
one night thirty year agone an’ more! Pore Tom
wears a sheet, ’e du, all mucked wi’ gore an’ gubber
... though why e’ should walk Wilmington way,
I dunno.”</p>

<p>“But this ghost, Mr. Dumbrell, wore a pair of horns—eh,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“Horns, indeed, sirs!” quoth Robert—“horns a
yard wide, I’ll lay my oath, and all afire!”</p>

<p>“’Orns!” exclaimed the Ancient One scornfully.
“I’ve seed ’em wi’ ’orns a-shootin’ out sparks an’
flame afore now, I ’ave! ’Orns? If ye was to go
up-along Windover, aye, or Furrel at midnight—which
nobody don’t never nowise du—you’d see more
on ’em wi’ ’orns than ye could count in a month o’
Sundays, aye, that ye would!”</p>

<p>“Allus s’posin’ as they’ve got the ‘sight,’ gaffer!”
added Mr. Potter. “Some ’as the gift o’ seem’ an’
some ’asn’t!”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in ghosts, Potter?” inquired Sir
John.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, I do—an’ then again—I doan’t. Ye
see, sir, it do ’appen as I’ve never ackcherly seen one,
prexactly, as ye might say, but that be because I ain’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
got the gift o’ seein’, but I ain’t consequently agoin’
for to deny the fac’.”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” quoth the Ancient One thoughtfully—“I
dunno as Windover bean’t a more likely plaace to
see ’em than Furrel, for it were on Windover as pore
young ’Obden was done to death, an’ the saame wik ’is
ghost ’peared tu James Sturton somewheres over by
the Long Man an’ nigh fritted ’e out o’ ’is moind.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Sir John, “this particular ghost,
considering his horns, would seem to be the very
devil——”</p>

<p>“Hesh—hesh!” shrilled the Ancient One. “Doan’t
’ee knoaw as <i>’e</i> aren’t to be light-spoke on? <i>’E</i>
doan’t like it no’ow! An’ if so be as <i>’e</i> be come
fur Mus’ Sturton, I dunno as it bean’t about toime.
An’ now my ale be finished an’ I bean’t agoin’ to ’ave
no more—an’ Jarge bean’t neither! And, look’ee,
Mus’ Robert,” he admonished, wagging bony finger
fiercely in the ex-corporal’s face, “if ye should hap’
t’ see my granddarter Ann, doan’t ’ee say naun to her
about this here liddle drop o’ ale, mind, or she’ll be
givin’ me a middlin’ dish o’ tongues, I rackon! Come
on, Jarge, an’ ’elp me inter the cart.”</p>

<p>This intricate manœuvre being successfully accomplished,
they jogged on together in company; and
Sir John noticed that Mr. Potter possessed a sweet
though singularly penetrating whistle, and that the
tune he rendered, a simple, country air, was always
the same. And Sir John further noticed that Mr.
Potter whistled only when in the neighbourhood of
certain cottages, and also that so soon as they approached
these habitations they would behold a man
leaning pensively over gate, or in doorway, or busied
in the garden, which men, glancing at Mr. Potter,
would always behold him in the act of smoothing his
neatly trimmed, left side-whisker; whereupon they
would nod and flourish hand, fork, mattock or hoe,
as the case might be, with a cheery hail of:</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, Jarge!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>At last, reaching a place where the ways divided,
Mr. Potter pulled up his horse.</p>

<p>“We be a-goin’ round Glynde way, sir,” he explained.
“If you should hap’ along to Alfriston, I’d be proud
to ’ave ye drop in on Potter, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Potter, I certainly will,” answered
Sir John.</p>

<p>“Aye, an’ you too, likewise, Mus’ Robert.”</p>

<p>“Thank’ee kindly,” answered the Corporal; “but
I’d like to ask you, Mr. Dumbrell, ha’ you ever known
a ghost take harm from a pistol-ball fired point-blank?”</p>

<p>“Never, nowise, nohow!” answered Mr. Dumbrell
decidedly, “and because why? Because ghostesses
be moighty ingenurious things, d’ye see, an’ can’t
never be ’urted nowhere an’ nowhen!”</p>

<p>“True for you, gaffer!” quoth Mr. Potter, surveying
a soaring lark with an expression of placid and guileless
pleasure. “I’ve ’eerd my grandfeäther say as it
weren’t no manner o’ good a-shootin’ at a ghost ’cept
you ’ad your piece charged wi’ a silver bullet, an’
even then ’twere allus to be expected as your bullet
might bounce off the ghost—backwent-like—an’ strike
ye wi’ mortal effec’, d’ye see. Good artenoon, sirs!”</p>

<p>“An’ mind this,” added the Ancient One, bony
finger a-wag, “it bean’t nowise ’ealthy-loike for no
man to go nowheres nohow, nowhere an’ nowhen i’ the
dark ’ereabouts—no!”</p>

<p>Hereupon Mr. Potter touched his horse with the
whip and away went that likely animal at such pace
that the rattling cart and its occupants were very
soon out of sight.</p>

<p>“Ha!” quoth Sir John thoughtfully, as they
pursued their way towards High Dering. “Hum!
The hunting of spectres would seem to be a highly
dangerous sport, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Agreed, sir!”</p>

<p>“And yet—notwithstanding—I think, yes—I think
we will adventure it one of these nights, Bob.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>“Very good, sir!” answered Robert the imperturbable.</p>

<p>Reaching Dering Village at last, an unpleasant
surprise awaited them; for no sooner had Sir John
dismounted before the ‘Dering Arms’ than he was confronted
by four stalwart men, formidable fellows
armed with sticks and clad in a neat livery who,
stepping out of the inn, stood grouped in the doorway,
barring his entrance.</p>

<p>“Well, my lads,” inquired Sir John, chin uplifted,
“what is it?”</p>

<p>“Ask ’im,” answered one insolently, a surly, blue-jowled
fellow, with a back-handed gesture towards
the woeful landlord who stood shrinking in the background.</p>

<p>“Be good enough to explain, Mr. Nixon.”</p>

<p>“Why, ye see, sirs,” mumbled the landlord, “these
be Mus’ Sturton’s men, an’ this be Dering, an’ Mus’
Sturton’s word is as you must go.”</p>

<p>“You mean that we are to be turned out?”</p>

<p>“Mus’ Sturton says as you must go, sirs,” repeated
the landlord miserably.</p>

<p>“Pray, what livery do these men wear?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, it be the Dering livery, though they be
straangers ’ereabouts——”</p>

<p>“Ha!” murmured Sir John, “I thought I recognised
it. And we are to go, are we?”</p>

<p>“An’ the sooner the better!” growled the blue-jowled
man truculently. Here ex-Corporal Robert,
leaving the horses to stand, made preparations for
instant action but paused in grim surprise, for Sir John
was laughing in sheer, unalloyed delight.</p>

<p>“You hear, Bob, you hear?” he gasped. “Come,
let us go.”</p>

<p>“Go, sir!” exclaimed the Corporal. “Go!”</p>

<p>“At once, Bob. So get our valises and effects—I see
Mr. Nixon has ’em all ready for us—and let us begone.”</p>

<p>“But—but ... go, is it?” stammered the Corporal,
clenching his fists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, Bob. Don’t you see we are driven forth of
Sir John Dering’s inn on Sir John Dering’s land by men
wearing Sir John Dering’s livery and acting under
instructions of Sir John Dering’s steward! It is all
quite delightfully grotesque! So get our things, Bob,
nor seek to ruin so exquisite a situation by violence;
let us rather steal humbly away. We will try Alfriston,
Bob.”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir!” sighed the Corporal. “But, sir, such
meekness, such—horrible meekness, your honour——”</p>

<p>“What of it, Bob?”</p>

<p>“’Tis so imprece-dented sir, as to be almost beyond
natur’, your honour.”</p>

<p>Laughing, Sir John remounted and, laughing still,
rode off to seek him a new lodging.</p>

<span class="smaller">MY LADY HERMINIA BARRASDAILE WEAVES WEBS FOR AN UNWARY HE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“Aunt,” cried my lady, tossing Mr. Steele’s
<i>Tatler</i> to the other end of the cushioned settee
and yawning prodigiously, “Aunt Lucinda, ’tis high
time I had you married again!”</p>

<p>“What, wench, what?” exclaimed the diminutive
Duchess, opening drowsy eyes. “Married, d’ye say?”</p>

<p>“So soon as possible, dear aunt. I intend to wed
you to a——”</p>

<p>“Heavens, Herminia, how harrowing—how hateful——”</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious preserve us, aunt, how can
ye?”</p>

<p>“Gemini! What now, child?”</p>

<p>“Smother one with alliterations.”</p>

<p>“Tush, miss,” exclaimed the Duchess, “and you
talk such pure folly so excessively extreme! Marriage,
indeed! At my age!”</p>

<p>“Aye, indeed, aunt! ’Tis high time I had thee
safe wedded, for, though so small, thou’rt a monstrous
responsibility, my dear soul. So I ha’ found thee a
spouse——”</p>

<p>“La, miss, hush and fie! I protest you make me
blush.”</p>

<p>“A monster, aunt!”</p>

<p>“Horrors, child!”</p>

<p>“Who could lift thee in one vast fist, thou dainty
atomy ... aye, and big me in t’other, for that
matter! A giant, aunt!”</p>

<p>“Herminia, you rave! What do I want with your
monstrous giants?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>“But he is a kindly monster, aunt, a most gentle
giant. And he is, besides, a baronet, a soldier, a
gentleman o’ birth and breeding, not ill-looking, nor
old ... not very; brave as a lion, vigorous with
health, strong as Samson.... Doth not all this
make thee to be a little in love with him?”</p>

<p>“Peace, child—cease, miss! You talk like a mad
thing.”</p>

<p>“So thou shalt come and look him over for thyself,
dearest aunt.”</p>

<p>“I won’t!”</p>

<p>“You will!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t desire to view any monsters, gentle
or no.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but then—I do, aunt! And so the matter
is finally settled!” said my lady, with determined nod.</p>

<p>“Goodness aid!” ejaculated the Duchess. “What’s
settled, Herminia?”</p>

<p>“We start as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Where for?”</p>

<p>“Sussex.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not go!”</p>

<p>“O aunt, thou dearest of small creatures ... thou
wilt not, thou canst not desert thy doating, solitary
niece. For, indeed, go I must.”</p>

<p>“Why, Herminia, child? Why, a heaven’s name?”</p>

<p>“To—to fulfil my destiny, aunt.”</p>

<p>“Herminia, be sane! Tell me what you mean by
‘your destiny.’”</p>

<p>“To fill his pipe and light it, aunt. To bring his
slippers. To cook for the pure joy of watching him
eat. To perform those humble, lowly, feminine duties
small in themselves yet that, in the sum, make for
the glory of true womanhood and lift her nigh the
angels.... Thus it went somewhat, the rest I ha’
forgot.”</p>

<p>“Pipe?” murmured the bewildered Duchess.
“Slippers? Whose?”</p>

<p>“Thy monster’s, aunt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“Herminia, my poor child! Thou’rt distraught—’tis
the sun to-day——”</p>

<p>“Nay, aunt, ’twas Sir John Dering, weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the little Duchess loudly, and
sitting up with sudden new interest. “What of the
dear man?”</p>

<p>“‘Dear man,’ indeed!” repeated my lady, clenching
white hands and stamping both feet at once.
“What of him? Oh, the devil confound him!”
Here my lady’s deep bosom surged tempestuously,
her eyes glowed, her delicate nostrils dilated; in fine,
she manifested all those symptoms of unruly anger
that may be vented only by your very great lady high
above the vulgar herd, on your slatternly virago very
far below. All of which the Duchess, wise in most
things pertaining to her own sex, noted with her keen,
shrewd eyes.</p>

<p>“My poor Herminia!” she sighed. “How long
have ye been in love with him?”</p>

<p>“Love?” gasped my lady. “In love?.... Listen,
aunt; I feel for him such unutterable deeps of bitter
scorn, such unspeakable loathing, such a world o’
detestation that I yearn to have him truly in love
with me.”</p>

<p>“Why, to be sure, child!” nodded the Duchess.
“Most feminine, under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Aunt, could I but once see him truly serious!
Could I but once shake his hateful calm, his cold,
passionless self-assurance ... oh, then!”</p>

<p>“What then, Herminia?” At this direct question,
my lady looked a trifle blank, whereupon the Duchess
answered for her: “Why then, child, you would make
of his passion a mock, to be sure, trample his humble
love under your proud hoofs—I mean feet—laugh
his suit to scorn——”</p>

<p>“Can you doubt it, aunt?”</p>

<p>“Never for one moment, my sweet.”</p>

<p>“He should learn at last the deep measure of a
woman’s scorn, aunt!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, my love. And then?”</p>

<p>“Then, aunt, why ... I should at least be
satisfied.”</p>

<p>“I wonder, child!... So here is why you will to
Sussex?”</p>

<p>“And to find thee a husband, aunt.”</p>

<p>“Tush for that, thou sly minx! But to watch
thee weaving webs for an unwary he, casting thy
spells, luring the poor wretch to distraction and
destruction.... Hum!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start at the earliest moment, dear
aunt. Let it be thought we are for your house in
Surrey or Kent—or anywhere you will. But once in
Sussex we must forget your rank; you must be a
superior inferior person, aunt, or better—a decayed
gentlewoman.”</p>

<p>“Horrors—no, Herminia! I refuse to be anything
so infinite abhorrent. Lud! I should sound like a
corpse!”</p>

<p>“Howbeit thou wilt always be my little, loved,
clever aunt.”</p>

<p>“But think, Herminia! What will the world
say?”</p>

<p>“Everything that is sayable, aunt; but what
matter?”</p>

<p>“But where must we live, Herminia?”</p>

<p>“In some small house or cottage suitable to our
humble circumstances, sure.”</p>

<p>“And how are we to find such place? And how
if no such place is to be had, child?”</p>

<p>“Fie, aunt! Remember thou’rt a duchess and can
do anything! You have hosts of servants, mostly
idle.’ There is old Hammond, your head courier,
reliable and trustworthy; let this be his duty.... A
cottage in or near Alfriston.... ’Faith, shalt write
to him at once!”</p>

<p>So, after due consideration, the Duchess sat down
to write forthwith, while my lady hurried away,
busied with a thousand concerns; and presently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
to the Duchess came Mrs. Betty in exclamatory
excitement:</p>

<p>“O mam, your Grace, and is’t true indeed that we
be a-leaving town, my lady?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Betty. I am taking your lady away to get
her married.”</p>

<p>“Married, mem? Lord save us all alive ... my
lady—married? O my lady—who to?”</p>

<p>“To the one man I have seen who may govern
her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, gracious goodness me, my lady! And who
can ever that be, your ladyship, pray?”</p>

<p>“One who, I think, may teach her happiness.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Grace, but O my lady—who?”</p>

<p>“A man, Betty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady, I guessed as much, mem, but——”</p>

<p>“A man she is head over ears in love with already,
poor child!”</p>

<p>“My lady—in love, mem! And never told me!
O mem! Oh, goodness gracious alive!... O your
Grace—who?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be inquisitive, Mrs. Betty. There, run
away, child.”</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW GEORGE POTTER CIRCUMVENTED THE PREVENTIVES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Since that dim, far-distant day when pious
hands first raised Alfriston Cross, it has endured
much by stress of weather and the passing of so very
many years. In its shadow may have stood Godwyn
the great Jarl, and his feoffman Aelfric; about it
lusty Saxon ceorls bartered and trafficked; past it
may have reeled some of the bloody wrack of Harold’s
army, desperate men weary from the fatal strife at
Senlac. Here has it stood through the centuries,
lashed by rain and wind, or drowsing in the sun,
while England waxed great and powerful. And as
it doubtless was once the place where Aelfric’s ceorls
and villeins bartered and chatted, so has it been a
familiar spot for lounging confabulation ever since,
and has propped the backs of “all sorts and conditions
of men” through countless generations.</p>

<p>And of all this untold host surely never was there a
back so suggestive of conscious innocence, of gently-assertive
rectitude and of guileful guilelessness as the
broad back of Mr. George Potter as he leaned there
this summer’s eve in murmurous, monosyllabic converse
with Master Tom Pursglove, the Tanner.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t nowise be no better, Jarge!” remarked
Mr. Pursglove.</p>

<p>“Nohow!” responded Mr. Potter, his limpid gaze
upon a gathering bank of clouds to windward.</p>

<p>“Black daark ’twill be, Jarge, an’ a risin’ wind t’
kiver the tramp o’ the ponies ’ooves.”</p>

<p>“Aye!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>“Yonder comes Godby at last, an’ along wi’ Joe
Muddle, Jarge.”</p>

<p>“I sees ’em.”</p>

<p>“They’ll ’ave been round givin’ ‘the word,’ I
reckon?”</p>

<p>“They ’ave, Tom.”</p>

<p>Here Messrs. Godby and Muddle sauntered up and
presently there were four stalwart backs against the
old cross.</p>

<p>“What be the tale, lads?” inquired Mr. Potter.</p>

<p>“Fourteen, Jarge!” quoth Mr. Godby, cutting a
quid of tobacco.</p>

<p>“’Leven!” said Mr. Muddle, tapping a large, horn
snuff-box.</p>

<p>“Which du mak’ thirty-seven on us, all told,”
added Mr. Pursglove, snuffing with Mr. Muddle.</p>

<p>“Ah!” nodded Mr. Potter; and so fell a ruminative
silence.</p>

<p>“Fine night, Jarge, ’twill be?” opined Mr. Muddle
at last.</p>

<p>“Sh’uldn’t wonder, Joe,” admitted Mr. Potter.</p>

<p>“But I do ’ear as the coastguard be doubled!”
quoth Mr. Godby.</p>

<p>“True, John,” nodded Mr. Potter. “They be!
Likewise the bozzlers be out!”</p>

<p>“An’ Will Comfort tol’ me as ’e seen sojers, a-marching
out o’ Brighthelmstone ’s marnin’, Jarge,”
said Mr. Muddle.</p>

<p>“Let ’em march!” murmured Mr. Potter.</p>

<p>“Ah,” quoth Mr. Pursglove, “Jarge’ll sarcumwent
’em some’ow, same as ’e done afore ... ’twas tubs
’arf-full o’ watter, buoyed very keerful off Burling
Gap, las’ time ... coastguard a-haulin’ of ’em in,
tur’ble busy, an’ us a-runnin’ the stuff at Cuckmere!
Sarcumwentin’s the word. What d’you say, Jarge?”</p>

<p>“’Ogs,” quoth Mr. Potter in somewhat louder tone,
his mild gaze still uplift heavenward, “’ogs, Tom,
takes as much knowin’ as an ’ooman—’specially sows!
There was Peter Bunkie’s gurt sow, you’ll mind, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
never littered less’n eleven, suddenly took it into ’er
’ead to starve—wouldn’t eat naun. Peter, ’e done
arl as ever man could for ’er, but ’tweren’t no manner
o’ good. Me an’ Peter ’ticed an’ cogged ’er wi’ arl
kinds o’ fother from rum-an’-milk, loo’-warm, to some
stuff in a bottle as Peter ’ad from the ’poth’cary the
time ’is leg was s’bad, but she’d ’ave naun, not she—turned
up ’er nose, ’er did, an’ being just as contrairy
as any ’ooman, closed ’er eyes an’ went an’ died.
The neighbours arl guv’ it their ’pinion as she was
took off by a information, but I b’liv’ as she was
a-grizzlin’ over summat as nobody knowed nothin’
about ’cept ’er own self, d’ye see? Good evenin’,
Mus’ Sturton, sir; ’ere be Potter a-tellin’ ’bout Peter
Bunkie’s sow an’ ’ere be you—a-bobbin’ up that
onexpected-like——”</p>

<p>“Look ye here, George Potter,” cried Mr. Sturton
in his peremptory fashion, big chin out-thrust; “look
now, and mark me——”</p>

<p>“Potter be a-lookin’, sir! An’—talkin’ o’ marks,
’ow’s your pore eye now, Mr. Sturton, sir?”</p>

<p>It was during Mr. Sturton’s rejoinder, a long and
eloquent denunciation of Mr. Potter, ending with a
comprehensive condemnation of his eyes, limbs,
lights, body and soul, that Sir John rode into the
village, the gloomy Robert at his heels, and unnoticed
by any one, pulled up in the shade of a tree whose
widespreading branches afforded a pleasing and kindly
shade.</p>

<p>“Lord, Mus’ Sturton, sir,” quoth Mr. Potter,
“’eavens know as I doan’t begridge nobody nothing,
but I’d gi’e summat for your gift o’ speech ... so
easy-like ... sech curses! So ’eart-felt——”</p>

<p>“I’ll see ye hung or transported yet for the rogue
y’are, George Potter!”</p>

<p>“I ’opes not, sir——”</p>

<p>“Hold y’r tongue!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be ’arsh, Mr. Sturton, sir——”</p>

<p>“We know ye for a poachin’, smugglin’ rascal——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>“Poachin’? Smugglin’?... Wot—me?” quoth
Mr. Potter in tones of pained surprise. “Mus’ Sturton,
if ever you catches Potter a-doin’ one or t’other, I
’opes as you’ll mak’ an’ example of ’im.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’re here for—look behind ye!”
cried Mr. Sturton triumphantly. “Are ye there,
Oxham?”</p>

<p>“All ready, Sturton!” boomed a jovial voice, and
out from an adjacent twitten stepped five brawny
fellows headed by a large, loud man who bore himself
with a jaunty truculence and wore his three-cornered
hat cocked at a defiant angle. At sight of whom, Sir
John frowned slightly: beholding which portent the
corporal’s gloom was lifted from him, and, freeing his
feet from the stirrups, he prepared for action sudden
and swift.</p>

<p>“Why, good-evening, Mus’ Oxham!” said Mr.
Potter serenely. “An’ ’ow might Lord Sayle be
a-gettin’ along wi’ his wounded arm?”</p>

<p>Mr. Oxham slapped coat-skirts with his riding-whip
and smiled unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“Well an’ hearty enough to attend to you, I reckon,”
he answered. “So are ye a-coming along with us
quiet or no?”</p>

<p>“But—wheer to, sir?”</p>

<p>“To my Lord Sayle, for sure!”</p>

<p>“On what account, sir?”</p>

<p>“Poaching,” cried Mr. Sturton. “Poaching in
the first place, and smuggling in the second, and for
being an insolent, shiftless, masterless rogue in the
third——”</p>

<p>“And in the fourth place,” smiled Mr. Oxham,
seeming bigger and louder than ever, “because my
lord wants ye! An’ that’s enough, I reckon!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” nodded Mr. Potter, “an’ where be your
warrant, sir?”</p>

<p>“Never you trouble for that, Potter! My lord
wants ye. Are ye comin’ quiet or no?”</p>

<p>“But this bean’t no kind o’ justice, sirs——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“Never you trouble about justice, Potter. You
can talk o’ that to his lordship. Now, are ye comin’
quiet or no?”</p>

<p>“Quiet!” answered Mr. Potter; “but you’ll be
s’kind as to allow me a drink o’ ale first?”</p>

<p>“Not by no manner o’ means!” smiled Mr. Oxham,
planting himself before his captive. “You are comin’
along with us, and you’re a-comin’—now!”</p>

<p>“I think not!” said a somewhat high, resonant
voice, and, riding from behind the tree, Sir John reined
in his horse and sat looking at the group, his chin
tilted imperiously, his eyes quick and keen.</p>

<p>“And who,” demanded the large Mr. Oxham,
smiling and slapping coat-skirts again—“who the
devil are you?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, Oxham,” answered Mr. Sturton. “A
no-account youngster as I’ve turned out o’ ‘The Dering
Arms’ ... knocked him into the dik’, I did, last
time we met——”</p>

<p>“And my name is Derwent!” added Sir John.
“And I will not suffer you to drag this man away—now
or at any other time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Oxham boomed derisive laughter and flourished
his whip for the benefit of the gathering crowd that
pressed ever nearer.</p>

<p>“Oh ... you won’t, hey?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Sir John. “And—look’ee, fellow,
next time you desire to laugh, turn away—your
gaping mouth offends me!”</p>

<p>“Why—why, damme!” stammered Mr. Oxham,
staring. “Offend you, is it? Ecod, I’ll do more
than offend ye if ye doan’t tak’ yourself off, and
sharp’s the word!”</p>

<p>“Aha!” exclaimed Sir John. “The vulgar rogue
actually dares to threaten!”</p>

<p>“Do ye tak’ yourself out o’ my way or doan’t
ye?” shouted Mr. Oxham, brandishing his whip.</p>

<p>“I do not!” answered Sir John, and with a motion
of slender hands, lifted the flaps of his holsters, discovering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
the butts of two serviceable pistols at his
saddle.</p>

<p>“Ho—murder, is it?” exclaimed Mr. Oxham,
falling back a step.</p>

<p>“Bob, should it be necessary, you will leave the
shooting to me.”</p>

<p>“I prefer my riding-crop, sir!” answered the
Corporal happily.</p>

<p>“And now,” continued Sir John, his eyes very
quick and watchful, “Mr. Oxham, Mr. Sturton and
gentlemen all, listen to me! I will not permit Mr.
Potter to be apprehended in this outrageous fashion
for the following cogent and excellent reasons, namely:
first, because ’tis against the law; second, because I
myself share Mr. Potter’s very natural aversion to
my Lord Sayle’s company; and, thirdly, because I
regard Mr. Potter in the light of a friend and, as a
Man o’ Sentiment, I feel the bonds of friendship very
sacred.... How say ye, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“You’m right, sir! Right you be!” cried a voice.</p>

<p>“Indeed, we are all with you!” added a second
voice, and Mr. Pym, the painter, appeared, hatless and
with a long-hafted prawning-net in his hand. “The
man Sayle has tyrannised hereabouts too long!”</p>

<p>“Aye, that ’e ’ave! That ’e ’ave!” cried others,
and the crowd surged nearer with an angry muttering,
insomuch that Mr. Oxham flourished his whip and
scowled, while his satellites, for all their brawn, began
to grow uneasy.</p>

<p>“At him, Oxham!” cried Mr. Sturton. “Pull
him from his horse; he won’t dare to shoot!”</p>

<p>“Try!” quoth Sir John.</p>

<p>“Aye, come on, if ye will!” added Mr. Pym,
brandishing his heavy-hafted net.</p>

<p>Here was a moment’s silence, and then Mr. Potter
spoke:</p>

<p>“Thank ye heartily, friends an’ neighbours—and
you most of arl, Mus’ Derwent, sir, but it bean’t no
manner o’ good a-muckin’ yourself up arl-along-on-account-of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
poor Potter’s affairs, not nohow. There
bean’t no man can’t nowise help poor Potter except
Potter himself, I rackon, and, sir—Potter be agoin’
to try!”</p>

<p>As he uttered the last word Mr. Potter leapt, brawny
fist a-swing with behind it all the weight, strength
and impetus of powerful body; and, felled by that
resistless blow, the large Mr. Oxham, for all his size,
rolled helpless upon the roadway, while over his
prostrate form leapt the fugitive and disappeared
through the open doorway of ‘The Market Cross Inn,’
but with Sturton and divers others of Oxham’s men
close upon his heels.</p>

<p>Next instant Sir John had plucked forth his pistols,
dismounted and, entering the inn, beheld Sturton and
his fellows staring around them and upon each other
in speechless, wondering dismay, for save for themselves
the place was empty; Mr. Potter, it seemed,
had vanished into thin air.</p>

<p>It was a proportionate, fair-sized room with sanded
floor, beamed ceiling and a wide hearth, where burned
a cheery fire screened by a huge, high-backed settle.</p>

<p>“Muster Sturton, sir,” quoth one man, glancing
uneasily about, “I don’t like this, blind me if I do....
A man as wanishes afore a man’s werry eyes ain’t
nat’ral, an’ I don’t loike it.”</p>

<p>“No more don’t I,” added a second. “One
moment theer ’e was, plain to see, the next ’e ducks
be’ind the settle yonder—you seen ’im duck, Sir—an’
then ... well ... ’e ain’t!”</p>

<p>“Hold y’r tongues!” boomed Mr. Oxham, striding
forward at this juncture, cherishing bruised face with
one hand, whip brandished in the other. “You,
Sturton, where is he? What’s come o’ the rogue?”</p>

<p>“Aye—what?” answered Sturton, his gaze wandering.
“I was close on him when he slipped behind this
here settle, and then—well, he ain’t here now, Oxham!
And I swear he never reached door!”</p>

<p>“But, damme,” roared Mr. Oxham, fetching the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
settle a resounding blow with his whip, “he must be
’ereabouts somewhere, man!”</p>

<p>“Aye, but—where?”</p>

<p>“Skulking in some hole or corner——”</p>

<p>“Why, then—find him, Oxham!”</p>

<p>Hereupon Mr. Oxham roared for Peter Bunkle, the
landlord; and after some while Mr. Bunkle condescended
to become visible, a shortish, broad-shouldered
man whose sturdy middle was swathed in snowy apron
and whose eyes were round and wide with innocent
inquiry; to whom Mr. Oxham, with much whip-flourishing,
set forth the tale of Mr. Potter’s so sudden
disappearance, demanding instant elucidation thereof
under pain of dire penalties to all and sundry.</p>

<p>“What, Jarge Potter vanished again, says you?”
inquired Mr. Bunkle, faintly interested. “Well, wot
o’ that—Lord, is this arl? Why, folks be allus a-disappearin’
’ereabouts—specially Jarge Potter; it do
be gettin’ quite an’ ’abit wi’ him. But, bless ye,
doan’t ye go a-worryin’—Jarge’ll come back safe an’
sound, ’e allus do—if ye wait long enough.”</p>

<p>“Now you, Bunkle, look’ee here!” boomed Mr.
Oxham, whip a-flourish. “We know as there’s a cargo
to be run to-night somewheres——”</p>

<p>“Cargo?” repeated Mr. Bunkle, vastly astonished.
“Oh? What of? Run where?”</p>

<p>“You know that well enough, Bunkle, but no matter!
We want Potter. Lord Sayle knows ’e be one o’ the
ringleaders, and he’s sent us to tak’ him, and tak’ him
we will.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, tak’ him,” nodded Mr. Bunkie, “an’
I’ll get back to my cookin’—as fine a jugged-’are——”</p>

<p>“Where is he? Speak up!”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Why, Potter, damme!”</p>

<p>“Lord, bean’t ye a-tellin’ me as he be vanished, an’
if he be vanished, I suppose vanished ’e be——”</p>

<p>“Where to, dang ye—where?”</p>

<p>“’Ow should I know?” sighed Mr. Bunkle. “An’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
that theer jugged-’are nigh ready to be dished—’ow
should any one know? Arl as I do know is as theer
be strange ’appenings ’ereabouts, aye, that there be;
country’s full o’ arl manner o’ unnat’ralness—visions,
spekiters—Mus’ Sturton seen a phanitum only t’other
night; didn’t ye, Mus’ Sturton?”</p>

<p>“Who says so—lies!” cried Mr. Sturton fiercely.
“And, Oxham, if ye hope to find Potter you’d best
search now ’stead o’ wasting any more time.”</p>

<p>“Aye, search be the word!” nodded Mr. Bunkle.
“I can show ye arl manner o’ likely places to search
in——”</p>

<p>“I’ll find the curst rogue if we ha’ to pull the danged
place about your ears——”</p>

<p>“Why, very good!” answered Mr. Bunkle, rubbing
his hands. “Only arl breakages must be paid for——”</p>

<p>“Paid for?” roared Mr. Oxham, louder than ever.
“Gimme any more o’ your imperence an’ I’ll pay ye
wi’ my whip!”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t!” answered Mr. Bunkle. “No, I
shouldn’t if I was you, Oxham.”</p>

<p>For answer Mr. Oxham raised his whip, only to
have it twitched out of his grasp from behind, and,
wheeling about, came face to face with the imperturbable
Robert.</p>

<p>“You ... you ...” he panted. “Gimme that
whip!”</p>

<p>“With j’y!” answered the ex-Corporal, stepping
back for space to strike.</p>

<p>“I suggest the fire, Robert!” murmured Sir John
from where he lolled upon the settle; and next moment
Mr. Oxham’s whip was among the flames, and before
its stupefied owner could find words, Sir John continued:</p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Oxham, you may depart and do your
expected bellowing elsewhere. I find you altogether
offensive!... D’ye hear me, fellow—go!”</p>

<p>Mr. Oxham’s large face grew inflamed and seemed
to swell larger, and he glared from the indolent figure
on the settle to his five uneasy stalwarts; but hard by,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
the corporal and Mr. Bunkle stood poised for action
offensive; in the doorway, Mr. Pym leaned upon his
prawning-net, and behind him loomed Messrs. Pursglove
and Muddle, while divers faces scowled in at the
open lattice. Observing all of which, Mr. Sturton
spoke:</p>

<p>“We’d best be going, Oxham. We’ll see no more
o’ Potter to-night, I reckon, leastways—not hereabouts.
We’d best be going——”</p>

<p>“Go?” roared Oxham. “Not yet, damme!”
And, speaking, drew a pistol from his pocket, but, in
that moment, down came Mr. Pym’s unerring prawning-net,
completely enveloping his head, and thus securely
netted he was deftly disarmed by Mr. Bunkle, who,
levelling the weapon at the gloomy five, commanded
them to begone; which order they promptly obeyed,
followed by Sturton and lastly by Mr. Oxham, hustled
ignominiously into the street, his head still enveloped
in the net, to be greeted by the laughter of all Alfriston,
as it seemed.</p>

<p>“We have raised the devil, I fear,” said Mr. Pym,
as the hooting and laughter died away. “We shall
have Lord Sayle down on us for this, which is bad,
and I have lost a very good net—which is worse!”</p>

<p>“But egad, sir,” laughed Sir John, “sure never
was net lost to better purpose! You’ll stay to crack
a bottle, I hope? You’ll do me the honour, sir?”</p>

<p>“Thank’ee, no, Mr. Derwent. I must be up and
away early to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“To paint, sir?”</p>

<p>“To prawn!” answered the painter, his eyes
twinkling. “An occupation less lofty, mayhap, but
equally absorbing, and often bringing more ultimate
comfort and satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“But, sir—surely a picture——”</p>

<p>“May be good or bad,” sighed the painter, “but a
prawn is ever and always—a prawn! Have ye ever
tried ’em—fresh boiled ... warm from the pot,
sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“Ah,” quoth Mr. Pym, “there is, sir, to your man
of delicate perception and fine sentiment, in the
strains of music, the glory of dawn, the glow of sunset,
the chaste beauty of evening, there is, I say, a tender
glamour, a joy inexpressible, but ... prawns ...
warm from the pot may reach the soul just as surely
though by a different avenue. Perchance to-morrow
you may learn this—if you will?”</p>

<p>So saying, the painter laughed suddenly, shook
hands and strode away.</p>

<p>“And now, sirs,” sighed Mr. Bunkle, carefully
uncocking Mr. Oxham’s pistol, “mindin’ that theer
jugged-’are o’ mine as ha’ been a-juggin’ of itself a
sight too long, if you’ll gimme your orders an’ lemme
go, I’ll be obleeged.”</p>

<p>“Can you give us accommodation here, Mr. Bunkle?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, that arl depends on how much, what-like
and when?”</p>

<p>“Two rooms. Now.”</p>

<p>“Was you a-thinkin’ o’ stayin’ ’ere, sirs? For
long?”</p>

<p>“Some weeks.”</p>

<p>“Think o’ that, now! Dunno as oi bean’t that
upset to tell you as arl my rooms be took, sir. But
theer be ‘The Star’ down the street, comfortable and
very ’ome-like——”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t take us, Mr. Bunkle?”</p>

<p>“Caan’t, sir! It bean’t nowise possible nohow
or——” Mr. Bunkle paused suddenly, for in the
circumambient air was a dull yet persistent knocking,
a noise very difficult to locate, that seemed now overhead,
now under foot, now behind the walls; hearkening
to which elusive sound, Mr. Bunkle’s eye grew dreamy,
he stroked his clean-shaven chin, he smoothed his
neat apron and, the knocks having subsided, coughed
and spoke:</p>

<p>“Two rooms, oi think you said, sir? Only two?”</p>

<p>“Two, Mr. Bunkle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>“Why, then, if two’ll be enough, I think ...
p’r’aps ... maybe we might ... manage it.”</p>

<p>Here three raps louder then before.</p>

<p>“Yes ... I be purty sure we can, sir.”</p>

<p>Here two raps.</p>

<p>“We will, sir.”</p>

<p>Here a single sharp rap and silence.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bunkle,” said Sir John, smiling, “we thank
you, and I can promise that you will find us very quiet
lodgers—full of sympathy and understanding.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, gen’elmen, if ye’ll trouble to step this
way, my mist’us will show ye your rooms.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">OF MR. BUNKLE AND THE ROOM WITH FIVE DOORS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Ten o’clock was striking, and the old Cross, deserted
and solitary, looked down upon a silent
village; and Sir John Dering, leaning out from his
open lattice, looked down upon the old Cross. Alfriston
slept, and had done so for an hour or more apparently,
like the highly decorous community it was; not a footfall
disturbed its chaste silence, not a light glimmered
anywhere.</p>

<p>A mournful wind moaned in fitful gusts, the signboard
of ‘The Star,’ farther down the street, creaked
dismally, but, save for this, all was brooding peace
and reposeful silence.</p>

<p>But presently Sir John’s quick ear distinguished a
sound not of the wind, though like the wind fitful—a
faint throb of galloping hoofs, now lost, now heard
again, growing ever louder; on they came, nearer and
nearer, until the dark street rang and echoed, but never
a door opened, never a light blinked, not even when
they slowed to a trot, to an amble, to a walk, and
finally stopped outside the inn of the ‘Market Cross’;
Alfriston slept on serenely persistent.</p>

<p>The moon, though obscured by a flying scud, yet
gave sufficient light to disclose the shape of horse and
rider looming gigantic in the dimness. Ensued the
creak of saddle and stamp of heavy foot as the horseman
alighted, and thereafter a knocking soft but imperative.</p>

<p>“Bunkle!” quoth a voice—“Peter Bunkle! Are
ye there, Peter man?” From somewhere adjacent
Mr. Bunkle answered, his voice sounding remarkably
wide awake:</p>

<p>“Be that y’rself, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“Aye. Are the lads by, yet?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, sir. But I doan’t expect ’em for another
’arf-hour. Be aught wrong, sir?”</p>

<p>“Soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Wheer away?”</p>

<p>“Lyin’ ambushed over by Exeat, an’ there’s more
of ’em ’twixt here and Frogfirle. I tell ye the country’s
thick with ’em.... I was stopped twice.... There’ll
be bloody murder ere dawn, Peter man!”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, Jarge Potter knows, an’ Jarge aren’t
nowise to be caught nappin’ nohow. ’E’ll send the
lads cross-country wi’ the stuff, I rackon, an’ lead they
so’jers a foine dance.... Bide a moment an’ I’ll
let ye in.” Here, after brief delay, the sound of
opening door, a heavy tread, a squeak of bolts and
silence again, except for moaning wind and the snort
of the horse below.</p>

<p>Then Sir John closed his lattice, and, taking up the
candle, stood awhile lost in thought; finally he stepped
from his chamber, closing the door behind him, and
descended the stair, to find himself in a crooked passage
full of dim nooks, odd corners and unexpected levels.
Presently, guided by a murmur of voices, he espied
a small door coyly hidden in most unlikely corner,
and, lifting the latch, beheld a small, strangely shaped
apartment further remarkable in that it possessed
two windows and five doors; and here, in an elbow-chair
before a smouldering fire, lolled the gigantic
form of Sir Hector Lauchlan MacLean. His riding-coat
was dusty like his long, booted legs outstretched upon
the hearth, his unkempt periwig excessively askew;
in one hand he held his cherished clay pipe, in the
other a steaming glass that gave forth a delectable
fragrance, while Mr. Bunkle busied himself at the table
with a bowl and ladle.</p>

<p>At the sudden opening of the door, both men glanced
up, and Sir Hector rose hastily.</p>

<p>“John!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Sir John bowed in his stateliest fashion, and so they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
confronted each other, Sir Hector flushed of cheek
and frowning a little as one at a loss; Mr. Bunkle,
suspending his operations, looked from one to the
other and, with instinctive delicacy, opened the nearest
of the five doors and incontinently vanished. Sir Hector
set down his glass and drew himself to his extremest
height, so that the curls of his peruke brushed the
carven beam above.</p>

<p>“Sir John Dering!”</p>

<p>Sir John’s bow was entirely formal, whereupon Sir
Hector puffed furiously at his pipe, but, finding it was
out, laid it very carefully beside his glass and scowled
blacker than ever.</p>

<p>“Sir John,” quoth he in his most precise English,
“on the last occasion we had speech I felt constrained
to tell you that you—lied!”</p>

<p>“Alas, yes!” sighed Sir John.</p>

<p>“And I named you liar because circumstances and
your very evil reputation seemed more than to
warrant it.”</p>

<p>“Perchance they did, sir,” murmured Sir John.</p>

<p>“Under the which circumstances, I was bound to
draw upon you,” continued Sir Hector ponderously,
“and you, sir, refused to fight, and stomached the
insult. Well, sir, are you suffering from an indigestion?
Have you thought better of your refusal?”</p>

<p>“I have!” answered Sir John. “Better and better.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, sir,” answered Sir Hector, reaching for
his long Andrea Ferrara from adjacent corner, “there
will be plenty of space for us in the tap-room——”</p>

<p>“But your arm, sir?” demurred Sir John.</p>

<p>“Tush—’tis well! Besides,’twas my left. But
where is your sword?”</p>

<p>“Upstairs, sir, where it will surely remain,” answered
Sir John, and smiled. And, meeting this smile, Sir
Hector loosed his great weapon very suddenly, much
as if it had burned his fingers.</p>

<p>“Johnnie—Sir John,” he stammered, “what d’ye
mean? Why are you here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“Surely, Hector, oh, surely you can guess—you
that were my father’s comrade and my best friend?”</p>

<p>Sir Hector turned to stare down into the fire, and when
next he spoke, voice and manner were wholly changed.</p>

<p>“Sir John ... John ... O Johnnie lad ... is
it forget an’ forgi’e ye mean ... for auld lang syne?
Can ye forgi’e so deadly an insult? Na—na, lad, bide
a wee!... Mebbe I was o’er hasty wi’ ye ... mebbe
I was no’ juist mysel’ ... mebbe—oh, my certie, I was
a muckle fule.... So, John—Johnnie man, if——”</p>

<p>“Why, Hector,” exclaimed Sir John, setting down
the candle rather hastily, “’tis all forgotten long since,
and ... and ... i’ faith, Hector, but your wig is
most damnably askew! Stand still and let me straighten
it for thee!”</p>

<p>And so Sir John reached up and resettled Sir Hector’s
peruke as he had been wont to do as a boy coaxing
forgiveness for some fault, or as a youth soothing the
anger of a none too stern guardian; and somehow Sir
Hector’s great arm, as it had ever done on such occasions,
crept about Sir John’s shoulders and rested there.</p>

<p>“John,” quoth he, “I’m gettin’ auld ... and age,
lad, is aye solitary.... We maun quarrel nae mair,
Johnnie!”</p>

<p>“Never again, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Forbye, there’s nae wumman worth it—no, not
one in a’ this warld, lad ... much less yon besom!
An’ I gave ye the lie, John—you as ne’er leed tae me
in a’ y’r days.... I tak’ it back—I withdraw it,
John, every word, here and now. I did ye wrang,
Johnnie, I did ye muckle wrang, an’ a’ by reason o’
yon feckless wench! I’m glad she ran awa’ ...
though I’ll no deny I’ve been a wee lonesome o’ late!
Ah well, come, lad, we’ll tak’ a glass an’ forget it—a
wee drappie o’ Bunkle’s gumboo whilk is a concoction
ye’ll no’ find in ony place but in Sussex, an’ worthy
sic a sweet country. Ye’ll drink wi’ me, John?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart, Hector! But pray remember
that my name is still Derwent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>Sir Hector nodded and rapped gently on the panelling,
at which summons one of the five doors opened
and Mr. Bunkle reappeared, though from a totally
opposite point of the compass; but scarcely had he,
smiling and deft, fulfilled Sir Hector’s order and Sir
John raised the fragrant beverage to his lips, than yet
another door was softly unlatched and Robert the
Imperturbable halted upon the threshold.</p>

<p>“Sirs,” said he, favouring them with that movement
that was neither salute nor bow and yet something
of both, “think it proper to report sounds of
distant musketry.”</p>

<p>“Musketry, Robbie?” exclaimed Sir Hector.
“Musketry, d’ye say?”</p>

<p>“The same, sir!”</p>

<p>“Did I no’ tell ye, Peter man, did I no’ tell ye?
There’s murder afoot! And a’ by reason o’ that de’il
Sayle, damn him!”</p>

<p>Silently Mr. Bunkle led the way into his unlighted
tap-room and, opening the wide lattice, they stood
there in the dark, hearkening with straining ears;
and presently, borne upon the wind from afar, came
the faint report of firearms, four or five shots in rapid
succession.</p>

<p>“That’ll be ’twixt here an’ Exeat, I rackon,” quoth
Mr. Bunkle.</p>

<p>“O man!” cried Sir Hector bitterly, “is it no’ a
fearfu’ thocht that Sussex lads—aye, neighbours
belike, may be murderin’ each ither?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” answered Mr. Bunkle, “it be only the
sojers, d’ye see——”</p>

<p>“The soldiers!” exclaimed Sir Hector, “and ’tis
Sayle hath brought ’em! Look’ee, John, hitherto all
men, coastguard, preventive and trader, being Sussex
men, have lived together like brothers—which, according
to ‘The Word,’ is a vera desirable an’ blessed
thing, y’ ken, John—not that I haud wi’ the nee-farious
traffic, mind ye, but ... but ... aweel, damn
Sayle, onyway!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>“’Eartily, sir! But never worrit,” admonished Mr.
Bunkle philosophically. “Arter arl, it be only sojers
a-shootin’ in the dark ... an’ even roses ’as thorns,
sir, and——” Here Mr. Bunkle paused as more shots
rang out.</p>

<p>“Tae the de’il wi’ y’r thorrns, man!” cried Sir
Hector, “yon was much nearer.”</p>

<p>“Why, so it were, sir,” Mr. Bunkle admitted; “but
they be only shootin’ at Jarge Potter, I do ’ope——”</p>

<p>“Hope, man, hope?” questioned Sir Hector fiercely.</p>

<p>“Aye, sir; ye see, whiles they sojers was a-laying in
wait for Jarge, Jarge were a-layin’ in wait for they
wi’ ponies an’ tubs arl complete an’ ’arf a dozen stout
lads. Well, sirs, s’ soon as they sojers spy Jarge,
away Jarge goes, though not too fast, an’ they sojers
arter ’im. Jarge do know every yard o’ the country
’ereabouts, ah, blindfold ’e do—an’ leads they sojers
up an’ down an’ ’ere an’ there by the ’ardest ways
’till, being a-top of an ’ill, Jarge gi’es the word, the
lads unloose a tub an’ away goes that theer tub
a-rollin’ an’ a-boundin’ down a-top o’ they sojers,
d’ye see, an’ away goes Jarge again in the dark ’till
’e feels like lettin’ they sojers ’ave another ’un an’
another ’till arl ’is tubs be gone ... an’ then gallop
it is an’ away goes Jarge leavin’ they sojers wi’ naun
to show for their ’ard labour ’cept mud an’ gubber
an’ bruises, d’ye see!”</p>

<p>“Ah—but the tubs, Peter man, they hae the tubs!”</p>

<p>“Oh ah, sir, they ’ave the tubs—plenty on ’em,
sir, full o’ ditch-watter! And the rest o’ the lads
safe away wi’ the stuff—ah, it should be arl stowed
safe an’ sound by now, I rackon! So doan’t ye worry
your ’ead nor yet grizzle, Sir ’Ector. They sojers
woan’t never ketch Jarge, not by no means, an’ in a
bit they’ll be a-marchin’ back a-carryin’ o’ they tubs
o’ watter mighty careful an’ that ’appy-’earted, sir—like
birds they’ll be—’till they finds out, d’ye see.
So——”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Bunkle’s eloquence was again disturbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
by shooting, a scattered volley so much nearer and
louder that Sir John instinctively peered from the
casement expecting to see the village start from
its slumbers in clamorous dismay. But Alfriston
slumbered on; it seemed as serenely unperturbed by
such trivial happenings as the old Cross itself, which
has doubtless known overmuch of the like episodes
in its weary length of days; not a door opened, not
a light glimmered, not a sound broke the chaste quiet
of its street save blustering wind and creaking sign.</p>

<p>“Aweel, aweel, I’m awa’!” quoth Sir Hector,
taking hat and cloak. “Say what ye will, Bunkle
man, musket-balls be ill things day or nicht, ye ken,
an’ amang the lads oot yonder be braw friends o’
mine, so I’m awa’——”</p>

<p>“What to do, Hector?” inquired Sir John.</p>

<p>“Wha kens, lad, wha kens! But yon men ha’ drunk
wi’ me an’ grupped ma hand in friendship, an’ I’ll dae
wha’ I may for ’em, be they smugglin’-bodies or no.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, I’ll come with ye, Hector——”</p>

<p>“Na, na, John! Hoot-toot, dinna be sic a muckle
fule—”</p>

<p>“If you go, Hector, so do I.”</p>

<p>“But think, John, gin ye’re taken by Sayle’s
soldiers, damn him!”</p>

<p>“Your risk shall be mine, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Well spoke, sir!” nodded Mr. Bunkle. “Sir
’Ector must not be mixed up in to-night’s business,
not no’ow, sir, so if you be his friend——”</p>

<p>“Bunkle man, hand that clapper o’ yours!” cried
Sir Hector.</p>

<p>“Your hat and cloak, sir!” said the imperturbable
Robert.</p>

<p>“Lead on, Hector, we follow!”</p>

<p>“John, ye’re an unco’ obstinate, self-willed——”</p>

<p>“I am,” laughed Sir John, folding long cloak about
him—“especially to-night!”</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” exclaimed Sir Hector, and strode
forth of the inn.</p>

<span class="smaller">TELLETH HOW SIR JOHN BEHELD THE GHOST</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Down a dark and narrow lane Sir Hector led
them, across a wide meadow, over a dim
stream spanned by footbridge, along a glimmering
road overhung by rustling trees, through a gate and
so to a grassy, wind-swept upland crowned by a
hedge with a mystery of trees beyond; a desolate
gloom full of ghostly stirrings, with mournful sighs
and groanings in every wind-gust. Here Sir Hector
paused suddenly and stood very still and silent.</p>

<p>“And, pray, what now?” questioned Sir John.</p>

<p>“Whisht, lad! Can ye no’ see I’m listenin’?”</p>

<p>“Aye, but why are you here? What do you
purpose, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Wull ye no’ be still, John?”</p>

<p>“Not until I know why you run such needless risk.
If the preventive officers discover us we shall be apprehended
as accessories. If you attempt to stay them
in their duty, you will be branded as a smuggler
yourself——”</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” exclaimed Sir Hector, emitting
a sound between laugh and groan.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of it all, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Then, John, if ye must have it” answered Sir
Hector in his precise English, “though as an elder of
the Scottish Church, a baronet, a general and a MacLean
o’ Duart, I do not hold with the lawless and therefore
nefarious traffic of smuggling, yet being also of a
reprehensibly perverse and damnably adventurous
spirit, I am the greatest smuggler of them all——”</p>

<p>“You, Hector ... you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“Myself, John! I own the <i>True Believer</i>, every
plank an’ spar an’ rivet—though ne’er a body kens
it save Potter, Bunkle and Sharkie Nye. Aye, an’
’tis mony a hundred guineas I’ve handled these last
twa years, but, bein’ elder, y’ ken, I’ve spent every
penny on guid warks ... there’s the wee chapel
ower to Berwick ... the row o’ almshooses ower to
Seaford ... there’s blankets an’ kindlin’ to comfort
auld banes i’ the winter. An’ yet, Johnnie, do what
I will, the kirk elder in me canna abide the smuggler,
whateffer! So whate’er the smuggler gains, the elder
spends.... And to-night that de’il Sayle hath
loosed strangers and soldiers on us, and thus ... if
the lads must run risk o’ bullet and capture, so will
I, since, like them. I’m just a smuggler. Aweel,
here’s my confession, an’ muckle glad am I to be oot
wi’t at last. An’ now, John, what’s your judgment?”</p>

<p>For a moment Sir John was silent, then he laughed
a little unsteadily and slipped his hand within Sir
Hector’s arm.</p>

<p>“O Hector—thou paradox!” quoth he. “Was
there ever stranger, more lovable anomaly than
Hector Lauchlan MacLean ... with his smuggling
and almshouses? ’Faith, thou soarest far beyond
my poor understanding. And who am I to judge
thee? And, besides——”</p>

<p>“Sirs,” said the Corporal in sudden, hoarse whisper,
“beg to report moving bodies on our left front.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, between the fitful wind-gusts was a
confused murmur of sound that grew momentarily
louder, until they could distinguish the muffled
trampling of horses toiling up the steep ascent.
Suddenly, afar in the dimness was the flash and report
of a musket, the whine of a bullet with a distant
shouting and clamour of pursuit. On came the
fugitives near and nearer, a vague blur, the dim
shapes of scrambling horses and men; nearer, until
the watchers could hear the snort of labouring animals,
the panting of men hard-pressed, a groan, a sobbing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
muttered oath of pain and weariness, and then a
voice cheery, dominating, familiar:</p>

<p>“Bear up, Tom lad, it be only a bit farther! Bear up
an’ we’ll cog ’em yet. You, Dick, is yon keg loose?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Jarge, it be.”</p>

<p>“Then let ’em ’ave it! Away wi’t!”</p>

<p>Ensued a creak of leather, a heavy thud, and away
down the slope bounded the unseen missile; and then
horses and men were past and swallowed in the pervading
gloom.</p>

<p>But from below rose shouts, cries and cheers, a
growing tumult, and up the slope straggled the pursuers,
a mixed company of soldiery and coastguards
pounding by with a rattle of accoutrements and the
dull gleam of bayonet and cutlass.</p>

<p>And then Sir John found himself running also, but
still grasping Sir Hector’s arm and keeping always in
the gloom of hedges; on and on till he was breathless;
past gloomy trees, across dykes and ditches,
stumbling and slipping yet still maintaining fast hold
of his companion’s arm; on through a dim-seen gate
and so along a dusty road until Sir Hector halted all
at once.</p>

<p>“Hark, John!” he panted. “Hark to yon!”</p>

<p>In their front was sudden clamour swelling to
exultant shouts and cheers, whereupon Sir Hector
cursed bitterly and hurried on again with tireless
stride.</p>

<p>“What is it?” gasped Sir John.</p>

<p>“They’ve captured some o’ the lads!” panted Sir
Hector. “An’ now ’tis tae the rescue or be taken
wi’ ’em ... loose me, John!”</p>

<p>“No, by heaven!”</p>

<p>“Johnnie man—loose me! My place is beside the
poor lads yonder.”</p>

<p>“And I say ’tis here——”</p>

<p>“By God, John—must I knock ye down?” Sir
Hector’s threatening fist was seized and held for a
moment in the Corporal’s powerful grasp, while they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
reeled to and fro, all three locked in desperate grapple.
Then Sir Hector, exerting his giant strength, hurled
the Corporal into the ditch, swung Sir John violently
aloft, and as suddenly set him back upon his feet, for
from the gloom before them rose a sound very awful
to hear, the shrill screaming of a man in the direst
extremity of agony or fear.</p>

<p>“Guid save ’s a’—what’s yon?” gasped Sir Hector,
as the dreadful sound shuddered to silence. “O man,
what awfu’ thing is chancin’?”</p>

<p>A sudden shot, followed by three or four in rapid
succession; a confusion of shrieks and hoarse outcries,
a wild, rapidly growing hubbub.</p>

<p>“They’re running, sir!” quoth the Corporal.</p>

<p>“They’re comin’ back!” cried Sir Hector. “D’ye
no’ hear ’em, Johnnie—d’ye no’ hear ’em?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Hector. And, by heaven, they run like
madmen! Quick ... behind this tree! Robert, are
ye there?”</p>

<p>“On your honour’s left flank!”</p>

<p>Crouched in the shadow, they waited; beheld dimly
a wild rabble of fleeing men who sobbed and groaned
and cast away weapons and equipment to aid their
flight. For there, flitting in pursuit, was a monstrous
and gruesome thing outlined in pallid flame, a gigantic
horror that lifted high in air two huge, widespreading
horns tipped with green fire. On it came, swiftly,
silently, a ghastly shape of fear, at sight of which Sir
Hector groaned aloud and strove to hide his gigantic
person behind the tree, while Robert, recoiling upon
his master, drew forth a pistol with shaking hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” cried Sir John in fierce command;
even as he spoke the fearful thing flitted past and all
suddenly was gone.</p>

<p>“Save us a’!” gasped Sir Hector. “Yon was a
kelpie!” And, sitting down at foot of the tree, he
took off his hat and wig to mop sweating brow, while
the Corporal stood rigid, glaring, hand tight clenched
upon the pistol he held.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>“Your honour observed its horns?” he questioned
at last hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I did, Robert!”</p>

<p>“Tipped wi’ fire, sir, an’ a yard wide, just as I told
your honour.”</p>

<p>“The description was very exact, Robert. I
recognised your ghost on the instant.”</p>

<p>“Ghost, is it?” quoth Sir Hector scornfully. “Man,
a ghost is a pretty poppet in comparison! Yon was
a kelpie, I’m tellin’ ye.”</p>

<p>“And the soldiers are all fled away, Hector, and
ha’ left their prisoners behind ’em!”</p>

<p>“And likewise most o’ their equipment, sir,” added
the Corporal.</p>

<p>“O John, O Johnnie man,” moaned Sir Hector from
his lowly seat, “’tis an awfu’ thing we ha’ seen this
nicht!”</p>

<p>“True, Hector. But Mr. Potter and his fellows are
safe, and we have taken no harm——”</p>

<p>“Whisht lad! Dinna be too sure; forbye, I’ve an
unchancy feelin’ in ma wame, an’ ma bowels be turned
tae watter, Johnnie!”</p>

<p>“Then I suggest a jorum of Mr. Bunkle’s gumboo.”</p>

<p>“Na, na, Johnnie! When a man sees a kelpie
’tis time for him tae think o’ ither things, y’ ken....
Come awa’ hame wi’ me instead, for ’tis a solitary
man I’ll be the nicht.”</p>

<p>Two o’clock was striking as they re-entered Alfriston
to find it still lapped in peaceful slumber. Reaching
his habitation, Sir Hector lifted the latch, but, finding
the door gently resistant, paused.</p>

<p>“That’ll be Wully Tamson,” he explained. “Wully
always sleeps across the threshold whin he chances
to be byordinar’ fu’. Hey, Wully man, wake up!”
And Sir Hector bowed mighty shoulder and hove the
door wide enough to gain admittance, whereupon from
the pitchy gloom arose reproachful groanings and
plaintive mutterings that ended in stentorian snore.
“Come in,” quoth Sir Hector from the dark, “an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
mind ye don’t tread on Wully.... So! Now wait
’till I find the candle.” Here the sound of ineffectual
gropings and a splintering crash. “A’ richt, Johnnie,
’twas only a platter,” Sir Hector explained, “though
what ’twas doin’ on the mantel-shelf I dinna ken....
I pit the candle here somewhere, I’ll swear ... ah!”
Ensued the sound of flint and steel and in due season
the candle was lighted to discover a small, disordered
room; before the ashes of a long-dead fire the single
elbow-chair bore a pair of dusty riding-boots and the
joints of a fishing-rod, while the table was littered with
sundry unwashed crockery, amidst which reposed a
weatherbeaten hat.</p>

<p>“’Tis no’ juist a palace, John, but what there is of
it is hamely.... If ye’ll pit some o’ the crockery on
the floor we’ll crack a bottle for auld lang syne—what—ye’ll
no’. Aweel, mebbe ’tis a little early
for’t, an’ we’ll be better in bed.”</p>

<p>“I think so, Hector. And I venture to suggest
your cottage might be made even more homely by a
woman with a brush, or a mop, or——”</p>

<p>“A wumman, Johnnie, a wumman? Hoot—toot,
she’d juist tidy a’ the comfort oot o’ the place wi’
her sweepin’ an’ scowerin’—a wumman? My certie!
I do verra weel wi’ Wully Tamson. Guid-nicht t’ye,
John——”</p>

<p>“Begging your pardon, Sir Hector,” quoth the
Corporal, standing at attention, “but what might a
kelpie be pre-cisely?”</p>

<p>“Why, Robbie man, a kelpie is a beastie that’s no’
a beastie, being supernatural y’ken, and yet ’tis a
beastie o’ sorts wi’ horns an’ hoofs, and no’ a healthy
sicht for ony man.”</p>

<p>“And wherefore not healthy, sir?”</p>

<p>“Havers, man, because it is a kelpie, for sure!
Johnnie man, I shall sleep wi’ my pistols handy this
nicht, for, though carnal weapons be no good against
bogles whateffer, more especially kelpies, there’s a
deal o’ comfort in the feel o’ a pistol in your cloof.”</p>

<span class="smaller">CONCERNS ITSELF MAINLY WITH THE “MORNING AFTER”</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The sun’s kindly beams were gilding the age-worn
old Cross and making it a thing of glory, for it
was a golden morning. And, looking from his lattice,
Sir John blinked drowsily in the warm radiance, though
Alfriston had been long awake and full of cheery,
leisured bustle. Borne to him on the fragrant air was
a mingling of comfortable, homely sounds: the faint
rattle of crockery, the clank of a pail, a snatch of song,
voices raised in greeting, a faint, melodious whistling,
with the clink of hammer and anvil. Indeed, the only
silent object in the whole cheery place seemed to be
the weatherbeaten old Cross itself.</p>

<p>Alfriston was serenely awake; folk went about
their business with a placid deliberation, or paused to
exchange comments on weather, present and to come,
on growing crops and things in general, but with never
a word for the desperate doings of last night.</p>

<p>True, Mr. Muddle, on his way to perform some
mystery with the pitchfork he bore across his shoulder,
limped noticeably in his gait, which was, as he very
willingly explained, “Arl-on-’count-of-my ol’ mare
as put ’er ’oof down ’pon my fut that ’ard as ’tis gurt
mercy I can walk at arl——”</p>

<p>Mr. Pursglove likewise exhibited a hand and forearm
swathed in bandages which, he averred ...
“moight ha’ been much worse, seein’ the bill-’ook I
’apped tu be a-usin’ of were so shaarp as a razor!”
Also divers others of the community discovered upon
their persons sundry bruises and abrasions, the which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
elicited little or no comment, for Alfriston, in its own
gentle fashion, was very wide awake this morning.</p>

<p>Thus Sir John, lolling at night-capped ease, looked
down upon this placid, homely scene, hearkened to
the soft-drawling, Sussex voices, breathed the fragrant
air and felt that life was good. All at once he started,
drew in his head with a jerk, and, snatching off his
tasselled night-cap, peered from the secure shelter of
the window-curtain.</p>

<p>She stood looking up at the old Cross, a tall, stately
creature, and yet, despite her stature, there was in
every supple line of her, in the very folds of her simple
habit, that same air of clean, rustic maidenliness that
Sir John remembered so well.</p>

<p>Her print gown was much the same as those worn
by other country maids, and yet its effect how vastly
different! How graciously it flowed, now hiding,
now half-revealing her shapeliness; how cunningly it
clung to pliant waist and full, rounded bosom. Her
jetty curls were ’prisoned in a small, laced cap; in her
hand she bore a deep-brimmed straw hat.</p>

<p>And thus, as she gazed up at the old cross, Sir John
gazed down on her, marvelling anew and happy in
his wonderment.</p>

<p>Now as my lady stood viewing the ancient cross,
there chanced by a country damsel with a large
basket upon her arm—a shapely young girl with a
remarkably trim foot and ankle.</p>

<p>“Pray, my dear,” says my lady, waving her hat
towards the old cross, “what strange thing is this?”</p>

<p>“O mam,” answers Rusticity, blushing and
curtsying, “it be only the ol’ market cross as arl
strangers do come to stare at.”</p>

<p>“Then,” says my lady, smiling, “they might do
better by staring at thee, for thou’rt monstrous
pretty.”</p>

<p>“O mam!” falters Rusticity, with another curtsy.</p>

<p>“What is thy name, child?” questions my lady.</p>

<p>“Ann, if you please, mam—Ann Dumbrell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“And why d’ye call me ‘mam’?”</p>

<p>“Because, mam,” answers Rusticity, blushing again,
“because you be so ... so fine, mam, an’ arl!”</p>

<p>“Heavens!” exclaims my lady with a pretty
petulance, “we must amend this, Ann! For look’ee,
child, I be no finer than thyself—just a simple, country
maid I be—and solitary. So I’ll walk with thee, Ann,
if I may. And my name is Rose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mam.”</p>

<p>“Nay, call me ‘Rose.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, Rose ... mam.”</p>

<p>“May I go with thee awhile, Ann? And don’t say
‘mam’!”</p>

<p>“Yes, m—Rose.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll aid thee with thy basket—come!”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no—Rose. My ol’ trug be naun heavy,
and your ’ands be so—so——”</p>

<p>“So what?”</p>

<p>“White an’ pretty.”</p>

<p>“Tush!” says my lady, scowling at the members
in question. “They be very strong hands, child. Come,
give me hold o’ thy basket!”</p>

<p>And presently from the shadow of his curtain Sir
John saw them walk away, the large basket a-swing
between them, and they laughing and chatting
together gaily.</p>

<p>No sooner were they out of sight than Sir John
tossed night-cap to ceiling and rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Bob,” quoth he as the Corporal appeared, “Bob,
why the devil am I not shaved and dressed?”</p>

<p>“Your honour’s orders were for your honour not
to be disturbed till ten o’clock, and ’tis scarce nine,
sir.”</p>

<p>“No matter, Bob. Hot water!”</p>

<p>“Here, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then have at me, Robert—proceed!”</p>

<p>“Im-mediate, sir!”</p>

<p>And Sir John’s toilet commenced forthwith; during
which nice business they conversed as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Any news, Bob?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Nothing to mention, sir ... though I did
’appen to hear that five soldiers and two o’ the
coastguard are reported wounded, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Nothing serious, I hope?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: We hope not, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: An ugly business, Bob.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: On-commonly, sir!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Have you seen or heard anything of Mr.
Potter?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: No, sir. It seems he’s vanished away
again, being badly wanted by the preventive
authorities. For I did ’appen to hear as ’twas
him as is judged responsible for most o’ the
casualties, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: To be sure, he was wearing his old frieze
coat! Ha’ you been far abroad this morning,
Bob?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: I did ’appen to step across the fields, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Very right, Bob. Health! Sunshine!
Dew!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: It was a little doo-ey, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: And you carried the basket, Bob, of
course?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Basket, sir...?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: <span class="smcap">Her</span> basket, Bob ... and pray keep the
shaving-brush out o’ my mouth!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Your pardon, sir!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Her basket, Bob!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: I judged it over heavy for a young fe——</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Damsel, Bob.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: To be sure ’twas too heavy—and I fancy
you ha’ lathered me enough.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: I think so too, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: She hath a remarkably neat foot, Bob!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: I have ob-served same, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: And her voice grows upon one.... A
voice suggestive of a nature sweet and——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: One moment, sir—your upper lip!</p>

<p>(A moment’s silence while the Corporal plies deft
razor.)</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: I chanced to see her in converse with a
young ... creature, Robert—a tall young woman
in a laced cap?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: I re-marked same young person myself, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Is she a friend of Mistress Ann’s?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Not knowing, can’t say, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Do you chance to know anything about
this—er—young person?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Nothing, sir, except as she seems to run
very much to legs——</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Legs—begad!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Pre-cisely, sir ... leggy, your honour.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Ha, leggy! Didn’t you think her a young
goddess?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: She didn’t strike me as such, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: But you must ha’ remarked her beauty?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Nothing to mention, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: But damme—her shape! Her form! Her
air! Her carriage! Her grace!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Too much of ’em all, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: ’S death, man—you must be blind!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Very good, sir.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: No, Bob, not blind—thou’rt merely in
love and that is infinitely worse.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: It is, sir!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Why, then, go a-wooing, man, go a-wooing
and put thyself out o’ thy misery one way or
t’other.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: Can’t be done, sir. Misery must be endoored.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Sir John</span>: Because thou’rt forty-five, Bob?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Robert</span>: And she’s scarce twenty turned, sir.</p>

</div>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Sir John portentously. “Hum!”
And, his toilet at last accomplished, he ran lightly
down the stair to find awaiting him a most inviting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
breakfast, of which he made short work, despite Mr.
Bunkle’s shocked remonstrances and reproachful
looks.</p>

<p>“This here b’iledam, sir,” quoth Mr. Bunkle, caressing
the edible in question with the fork of an expert—“this
here b’iledam desarves to be ate respectful an’
dooly slow, wi’ thought to every chew an’ a pause
betwixt each swaller!”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Mr. Bunkle,” smiled Sir John as he
rose from the table, “but, like the chameleon, I could
feed on air—for a time at least! Robert, my holly-stick!
I think I will call on our Ancient Mr. Dumbrell.
Have ye any message, Bob?”</p>

<p>“None, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, I must invent some. You might step
over to Dering later in the day, Robert. Adieu, Mr.
Bunkle.”</p>

<p>“Dinner at ’arf-past twelve, sir!” sighed Mr.
Bunkle, laying down the carving-fork, “roast Sir Loin—’ot!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="smaller">TELLETH HOW MR. DERWENT BEGAN HIS WOOING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Away strode Sir John across sunny fields, light
of foot, treading a springy turf, breathing a
fragrant air, swinging his holly-stick and vaulting
stiles for the pure joy of it all. Birds piped and
chirped from hedge and thicket, larks carolled in the
blue, rills bubbled and laughed, and scabious flowers
danced and swayed in the gentle wind in tune with
the universal gladness.</p>

<p>And so in good time came Sir John to High Dering.
For there, perched upon his accustomed stile in well-brushed
hat and snowy smock-frock, sat the Ancient
Person in animated converse with one who leaned
gracefully against the gnarled post of the old stile,
listening to the Aged One’s talk, but watching Sir
John from the shadow of her hat, with eyes quick to
heed all the careless, easy grace of him as he came
light-treading across the sun-dappled ling.</p>

<p>“Rose!” said he, and bared his head; now,
beholding her startled, upward glance, how should he
know of the eyes that had taken such note of his
altered appearance, his plain attire? “Rose,” said
he, “thou rose of love!” And stood bare-headed,
glad-eyed, to await her greeting.</p>

<p>“La, Mr. Derwent,” said she, “you wear strange,
small hat, sir, yet methinks it do become you better
than your night-cap!”</p>

<p>“And yet ’tis a very excellent night-cap!” he
retorted.</p>

<p>“Eh—eh?” piped the Aged One. “Be ye man
an’ woife, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>“Not yet, Mr. Dumbrell, but——”</p>

<p>“Then wot’s she know about your noight-cap,
young man, eh—eh? Tell oi that!”</p>

<p>“I—I saw it this morning,” explained my lady,
rather hastily—“this morning as he leaned out of
his chamber window——”</p>

<p>“Then, young man, ’ow dare ’ee stick y’r noight-cap
out o’ winder in a purty maid’s face? Shamed
at ’ee, oi be!”</p>

<p>“But I drew it in again, Mr. Dumbrell!”</p>

<p>“No matter, young man, oi be shamed at ’ee! Wi’
y’r noight-cap an’ arl!”</p>

<p>“It shall not happen again, Mr. Dumbrell.”</p>

<p>“Oi be a ol’, ancient man, aye—a aged soul, oi be,
an’ oi knaws wot oi knaws an’ oi knaws as us doan’t
want ’ee, young man, wi’ your noight-cap, an’ arl!”
Here the Aged One glared at the intruder with
truculent eye, but Sir John was looking at my lady,
of course.</p>

<p>“So I have found thee at last, my Rose!” said he
softly.</p>

<p>“Ha’ you looked for me, sir?”</p>

<p>“These very many weary days, child.”</p>

<p>“Your honour expected me, then?”</p>

<p>“Hourly.”</p>

<p>“And now that you behold me?”</p>

<p>“Now, Rose, the sun shines, the birds sing, the
scabious flowers are a-dance in their myriad hosts,
and here standeth John Derwent to woo thee——”</p>

<p>“Well, go ’way!” snarled the Aged One fiercely.
“Go ’way; us doan’t want ’ee no’ow, young man!
Us be a-’arking to each other an’ doan’t want nobody—du
us, my pretty? Lord, ’e du ha’ put me out!
Wot was oi a-tellin’ ye, my dainty dear?”</p>

<p>“Of the day you and Sir Hector saved old Penelope
the witch from being drowned ... but the sun is
very hot, pray put your hat on again, Mr. Dumbrell!
Nay, suffer me!” So saying, my lady took the well-brushed
hat and set it upon the old, white head so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
gently and with such pretty grace that the Aged One
leered at Sir John in chuckling triumph.</p>

<p>“Us doan’t want ’ee, young man, du us, my
flower?”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” she laughed, “but you find wondrous
pretty names for me——”</p>

<p>“Because ’tis purty you be ... no, ’andsome’s
the word—a foine ’andsome wench.”</p>

<p>“But over-large for a flower, I fear,” she sighed.</p>

<p>“Sizeable!” nodded the Aged One. “But oi
loikes ’em big—allus did. So doan’t ’ee worrit naun
’count o’ y’r size. An’ as fur ol’ Penelope, ’er desarved
arl ’er got, bein’ a witch.... An’ when it come to
savin’ of ’er, I dunno as Sir ’Ector done so tur’ble
much! Oi be an ol’ ancient man, but oi bean’t nowise
doddlish, an’ can save a witch as well as some young
’uns an’ better’n most—ah, that oi can!”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it! And is she still alive?”</p>

<p>“That she be. Witches bean’t easy to kill an’
doan’t aften doi—not in Sussex, they doan’t. Oi been
buryin’ folk arl my days an’ oi only buried one witch,
an’ ’er only doied because she ’appened to drown, not
being able to swim wi’ a stone round ’er neck, d’ye
see——”</p>

<p>“A—a stone?” exclaimed my lady in tones of
horror.</p>

<p>“Aye, a stone fur sure, my pretty. Toied ’un
round ’er neck, they did, an’ ’ove ’er into the river,
they did, an’ so ’er doied. But this were years an’
ages ago, when oi were younger. And ol’ Penelope
be a tur’ble powerful witch—give me a spell agin the
axey as done me arl manner o’ good.”</p>

<p>“Did she cure you by magic?”</p>

<p>“Lord bless y’r pretty eyes—no! There bean’t
nobody nor nothink can cure oi, what wi’ that theer
ol’ musket-ball o’ mine. But oi were moighty bad,
an’ ’long come a man one day in a p’inted ’at an’ a
gownd wi’ silver stars on to it an’ sold me a charm
wrote on a three-carnered piece o’ paper wi’ these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
words as oi were to say three toimes over, marnin’,
noon an’ noight:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">Well, oi sez ’em over an’ over ’till oi were black i’

must rub arl over myself ... which oi done. An’
Lord—arter a bit oi got that skittish—used t’ kick
up my ’ind legs loike any colt ... an’ me a married
man an’ arl. Oi dunno as if oi——”</p>

<p>“Grandfeäther!”</p>

<p>“Dannle it! That be my rum-an’-milk!” exclaimed
the Aged One, scowling.</p>

<p>“Grandfeäther, be ye comin’?”</p>

<p>“Arl roight, lass, arl roight!” piped the old man
pettishly, getting from his perch with surprising
nimbleness. “Oi’ll ’ave to go, my pretty bird, oi’ll
’ave to leave ’ee or ’twill be milk an’ no rum! Ann
be that ’ard-’earted an’ ... Arl roight, Nan, ’ere oi
be!” This as his granddaughter appeared, who, beholding
Sir John, blushed and curtsied. Quoth she:</p>

<p>“’Tis tur’ble kind o’ you to bide an’ keep ’im
comp’ny, Rose—mam, for ’e du be that mischievious——”</p>

<p>“Never tak’ no ’eed o’ my Nan, ’er’s a babe!”
retorted the Aged One. “An’ oi du ’ope as you’ll
come an’ talk tu oi again, my Beauty Broight, fur oi
doan’t tak’ naun account o’ little ’uns, an’ you be a
foine up-standin’, down-sittin’ wench, sure-ly! An’
the young ’un ’ere thinks the same, doan’t ’ee, young
man?”</p>

<p>“I do!” answered Sir John fervently. “Indeed,
I have never seen a more up-standing, down-sitting
wench in all my life!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, whoy doan’t ’ee up an’ tell ’er so,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
wi’out me a-doin’ it fur ’ee. You be sweet on ’er,
oi s’pose?”</p>

<p>“Monstrous so!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, whoy caan’t ’ee tell ’er summat about
it? Ye caan’t expect oi tu du it fur ’ee arl the toime.
’Ere you’ve stood a-lookin’ an’ a-starin’ an’ so silent
as a turmut! That bean’t no waay tu win a wench—no!
Lord, oi were different in my young days; oi
knawed the waay tu go a-wooin’! An’ oi ain’t forgot
yet, though I be such a ol’, aged soul!”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you will help me, now and then?”
Sir John suggested.</p>

<p>“Whoy, sence you ax me so sensible an’ modest-loike,
oi dunno as oi wun’t. For, if you bean’t much
to look at, you be batter’n some, an’ she moight du
worse.”</p>

<p>“It is possible!” sighed Sir John.</p>

<p>“So oi dunno as oi wun’t put in a word for ’ee noo
an’ then wi’ the lass. But moind ye if oi win ’er for
’ee an’ she doan’t turn out arl as you expect, an’
woives never do no’ow, doan’t ’ee go fur to blame
oi!”</p>

<p>“Grandfer, your rum-an’——”</p>

<p>“Hesh a minute, Nan, hesh an’ lemme finish, will
’ee? Marriage, young man, be arl roight whiles ye
be single, but when you be married ’tis generally-mostly-arlways
arl wrong—oi’ve troid it twoice, an’ oi
knaw! So jest so soon as she begins to feel weddin’ish,
oi leaves the matter to you. An’ now, Nan, gimme
y’r arm!”</p>

<p>“Boide a minute, Grandfeäther——”</p>

<p>“Whaffor, Nan? Ain’t ye kep’ me a-waiting long
enough?”</p>

<p>“I’ve a message for the gen’elman——”</p>

<p>“Gen’elman, lass? ’Oo? Wheer? D’ye mean—’im?”
And the Aged One pointed at Sir John
with wavering stick. “’E bean’t no gen’elman—look
at ’is ’at! Gen’elman’s ’ats ’as goold lace onto ’em
loike Sir ’Ector’s of a Sunday an’ Lord Sayle’s of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
week-day. Look at ’is coat—so plain! An’ ’e aren’t
got no sword neether! Gen’elman—’im? ’E be
jest a respectable young man——”</p>

<p>“You hear that, Rose?” cried Sir John, ecstatic.
“You hear? There speaketh hoary Wisdom!”</p>

<p>“’Oo’s ’oary—me?” demanded the Aged Soul,
scowling.</p>

<p>“Yourself, Mr. Dumbrell, and are therefore to be
revered. Your hand, Sir Reverence, your hand, I beg!”</p>

<p>“Whoy, oi dunno as oi loike the sound o’ that ’ere
word——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dumbrell, you in your nescience saw ’neath
the hollow shams and know me for what I truly am,
a respectable young man. O most excellent Aged
Soul, I thank thee for that word! Mr. Dumbrell,
your hand, pray.”</p>

<p>So, after some little hesitation, the sharp-tongued,
little old man reached tremulous hand to Sir John’s
warm clasp, and, looking up into Sir John’s smiling
eyes, the Aged Soul smiled also; quoth he:</p>

<p>“Young man, oi dunno as you bean’t better-lookin’
than what oi thought—leastways your eyes is worth
any lass a-lookin’ at, oi rackon, an’—whoy, what be
this ’ere?” And the old man stared down at his open
palm. “By the pize—a guinea! Dannel it, young
man, what be this fur? What do ’ee mean by it?”</p>

<p>“Do not be angry, Mr. Dumbrell; pray accept it as
a small mark of esteem and gratitude from one respectable
man to another.”</p>

<p>“Whoy, since you puts it that ways, young man,
we woan’t arg’ about it, an’ oi dunno as oi bean’t
almoighty glad of’t.... A guinea, Nan, a goolden
guinea! ’Ere be baccy for oi an’ that ’ere cherry
ribband for you, an’ sugar for oi, an’ a noo ’at for
oi.... Young man, oi thank ’ee, an’ so du Nan....
Thank ’un, Nan; mak’ y’r reverence an’ show y’r
manners, lass!”</p>

<p>“Not forgetting your message, Ann,” prompted Sir
John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” she answered, curtsying repeatedly,
“though ’twere only Gammer Haryott as bid me say
if I see you, sir, as she would like a word wi’ you, sir.”</p>

<p>“What about my rum-an’-milk?” demanded the
Aged Soul pettishly. “’Ere be oi a-vadin’ an’
famishin’ an’ perishin’ awaay, an’ you a-maggin’ an’
me a-waitin’ an’ nobody to ’tend to oi no’ow, nowhen
nor nothin’! Come an’ gimme my rum-an’-milk or
no ribbands, moind that! G’marnin’, young man, an’
doan’t ’ee go a-throwin’ your money away so woild-loike
an’ rackless! Marnin’, my purty dear! You’ll
foind oi settin’ a-top o’ stoile every marnin’ when it
be sunny.” So saying, the Aged Soul bared his white
head gallantly, nodded, and suffered his dutiful granddaughter
to lead him away.</p>

<p>My lady was silent awhile, watching them as they
went, the girl so young and strong and motherly, the
old man so bowed and feeble; and Sir John, regarding
his companion keen-eyed, saw in her look an unwonted
tenderness and, when at last she spoke, heard her voice
strangely tender also.</p>

<p>“O Sussex!” she murmured. And then: “They are
worth caring for, these unspoiled folk o’ the Down
Country.”</p>

<p>“They are, Herminia!” he answered. At this she
turned and looked at him, frowning a little.</p>

<p>“Have you done so, Sir John?” she questioned.
“Have you cared for their comfort and welfare?”</p>

<p>“Alas, no!” he answered. “I, like you, my lady,
have preferred the town hitherto, and, heaven help
me, was therewith fairly content! Which is matter
for some wonder, for here were the Downs and here
the Dumbrell——”</p>

<p>“That Aged Soul!” she added, smiling suddenly.
“As gallant as any town beau, more dignified, and
infinitely more sincere.”</p>

<p>“Rose child, I perceive thou hast also found eyes to
see withal!”</p>

<p>“Is this so amazing, your honour?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>“Not so much as to behold a fine lady who honours
Rusticity and finds joy in simple, homely things.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I do love the country, especially Sussex,
for, as your honour may ha’ forgot, I was born here.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you will, I can show you other wonders.
First, there is Dame Penelope Haryott, whom fools
call a witch and rogues have sought to murder, ere
now.”</p>

<p>“Murder!” exclaimed my lady, wrinkling her
brow. “Oh! And yet surely witches be horrid
creatures! Ha’n’t you read of ’em?... Leagued
with all manner of evil spirits for the working of evil....
Ha’n’t you read what learned philosophers ha’
writ concerning’ em, sir?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, if this woman be truly a witch——”</p>

<p>“But was there truly ever a witch, child?”</p>

<p>“Your honour may have heard of the Witch of
Endor?”</p>

<p>“Hum!” quoth Sir John. “Can it be that you
believe in witchcraft, black magic and the like
fooleries?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you, sir?”</p>

<p>“No more than I do in ghosts, child.”</p>

<p>“The girl Ann tells me that ghosts often walk in
these parts.”</p>

<p>“Aye, so they do,” laughed Sir John, “and to some
purpose.”</p>

<p>“Then, despite the Bible and philosophers, your
superior wisdom doth not believe in witches?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Nor ghosts?”</p>

<p>“No, child.”</p>

<p>“Because you chance never to ha’ seen one, sir!”</p>

<p>“Because I have, rather. Indeed, Rose, a most
effective ghost——”</p>

<p>“You have positively seen a ghost? When?
Where?” she demanded. But, turning a bend in the
road they came upon a horseman, a cadaverous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
person in threadbare clerical garb, who bestrode a
very plump steed.</p>

<p>“A fair prospect to the eye!” he exclaimed, nodding
gloomily towards Dering village, where it nestled
under the sheltering Down. “Aye, a fair prospect,
and yet, in very truth, a ‘whited sepulchre’ ... not
a thatch that doesn’t leak, scarce a cottage that is
truly habitable——”</p>

<p>“Shameful!” exclaimed my lady.</p>

<p>“And wicked!” added the parson in his gentle voice,
his haggard face very woeful. “For how shall folk take
heed to their soul’s welfare until their bodies be comfortable?
Alas, you behold yonder the evils of a bad
landlord. Sir John Dering hath much to answer for.
Better he were dead and the land in better keeping.”</p>

<p>“Dead, sir!” exclaimed my lady, aghast.</p>

<p>“And wherefore not?” continued the parson in
his gentle accents, while his eyes smouldered. “A
merciless, grinding bailiff and a profligate landlord
make for a suffering tenantry.”</p>

<p>“You are the Reverend Mr. Hartop, I think, sir?”
questioned Sir John, bowing.</p>

<p>“The same, sir,” answered the parson, returning
the salute. “And I, who know and love these rustic
folk, say again that for the general good, an evil
landlord is better dead.... And consider Sir John
Dering’s reputation, his scandalous life!”</p>

<p>“True!” sighed Sir John; “his reputation doth
show him a very monster of iniquity.”</p>

<p>“God forgive him!” sighed the parson. “Duellist
and man of blood, desperate gambler and of wild,
unholy life.... A few poor hundreds of the guineas
he throws away at the gaming-table or wastes on
nameless evil would mean all the difference ’twixt
misery and happiness, sickness and health to the folk
of High Dering. Heaven forgive the Wicked Dering
the evil he hath wrought.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” added Sir John. “How potent and far-reaching
is a man’s reputation, Rose!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>“How different the son from his honoured sire!”
sighed Mr. Hartop.</p>

<p>“Alas, yes, sir!” answered Sir John. “And yet,
sir, I have it on excellent authority that this most
iniquitous gentleman hath lately become a ‘respectable
young man.’”</p>

<p>“Sir,” exclaimed the parson, opening his mild eyes
a little wider than usual, “sir, you amaze me!
Heaven send it be indeed so, for his own sake and
the future welfare of his neglected people.” Saying
which, Mr. Hartop lifted shabby hat and rode gloomily
away.</p>

<p>“‘For the general good,’” repeated Sir John
wistfully, “‘for the general good an evil landlord
were better dead.’ Here is an arresting thought,
child ... and how bitterly true!”</p>

<p>“But you are alive!” said she, staring towards the
quiet village beneath wrinkled brows. “Live, then,
to better purpose.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Rose,” he sighed, “thy pretty moralities fall
so trippingly from thy rosy, innocent lip; thou art in
thy simple wisdom such an angel of inspiration that
I would we had met ... five weary years ago!”</p>

<p>“Five years ago?” she repeated, turning upon him.
“Have you forgot——?” Here, beholding his grim-smiling
mouth, the mockery of his eyes, she caught
her breath and was silent.</p>

<p>“Five long years ago, child, I killed a man—by
accident. Ah, sweet Rose, gentle maid, if only thou
hadst come to me then ... to soothe my bitter
grief! Dear, lovely Rose, that little ‘if’ held, then
as now, a world of possibilities even for such an
abandoned wretch as ‘the Wicked Dering.’ But we
are still alive, and to live is to hope.... And Dame
Haryott desires speech with me. And thou would’st
behold a witch, so come thy ways with thy loving,
gentle John.”</p>

<p>“Gentle?” cried she angrily. “Aye, with the eyes
of a mocking fiend!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“But the heart of a respectable young man, Rose!”</p>

<p>“Your crime brought its own consequences, sir.”</p>

<p>“It did!” he sighed. “And not the least of ’em,
thyself! When wilt marry me?”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“Then the matter being settled—for the present
let us to the witch, hand in hand like good friends.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Leave me, sir!”</p>

<p>“Give me thy hand.”</p>

<p>“Oh—I hate you!” she cried passionately.</p>

<p>“Good!” he nodded placidly. “’Tis better than
indifference. Thy hand, Rose.”</p>

<p>For answer she turned away, silently contemptuous,
and began to retrace her steps; but he caught her
wrist and checked her suddenly, whereupon she struck
viciously at him, knocking off his hat, then her other
hand was ’prisoned also in so tense a grip that, knowing
it vain to struggle, she disdained further effort and
faced him, coldly defiant.</p>

<p>“Coward, you hurt me!”</p>

<p>“Madam, you behave like a peevish hoyden! Such
tricks may pass with your hysterical fine ladies but,
while in Sussex, I suggest you ape the dignified calm
o’ Rusticity.”</p>

<p>“Will you loose me?”</p>

<p>“Are you done with your fishwifely tantrums?”</p>

<p>My lady held herself pridefully, glared furiously,
then suddenly bit her lip, bowed her head, and something
bright and sparkling fell upon his hand; at this
he loosed her suddenly and she as suddenly turned
her back upon him.</p>

<p>Sir John picked up his hat, knocked the dust from it,
put it on, and stood regarding her pensively.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said he at last, “dear child, suffer me to
take thy hand.” Then he reached and clasped her
unresisting fingers; and thus, hand in hand, they
went on down the lane together.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">TELLETH HOW MY LADY ADOPTED A FAIRY GODMOTHER</span></h2>

</div>

<p>High Dering, drowsing in the sun, opened a
door here and there to stare in idle wonderment
as Sir John handed his companion in at Dame Haryott’s
garden wicket, for visitors were rare, more especially
such visitors as these who bowed and curtsied to
each other with such courtly, albeit frigid, ceremony;
so High Dering opened its doors a little wider and
became a trifle more awake as Sir John knocked.</p>

<p>And, after some while, chains rattled, bolts creaked,
the heavy door opened, and old Penelope stood peering
at them from the dim interior.</p>

<p>“Good-day, Mrs. Penelope,” said Sir John, removing
his hat and saluting her in his easy, unaffected manner.
“You desired to see me, I think?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I did,” she answered ungraciously, “but not
along of a tattlin’ wench.”</p>

<p>My lady stared and flushed angrily.</p>

<p>“I will go!” said she, and drawing herself to her
noble height, turned away, supremely disdainful as
an outraged goddess; but old Penelope, who knew
little of goddesses and cared less, was no whit abashed.</p>

<p>“Hoity-toity!” quoth she; “bide a bit, wench!”
and my Lady Herminia found her stately progress
checked by the crook of old Penelope’s stick that had
hooked itself suddenly about her arm.</p>

<p>My lady turned and, amazed beyond speech, viewed
the audacious old creature from head to foot until,
meeting the fierce old eyes, her gaze paused there and
thus, for a long moment, they stared at each other,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
the old woman and the young, while Sir John wisely
held his peace.</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Dame Haryott at last, looking
more malevolent and witch-like than usual, “an’ who
be you, young mistress, wi’ y’r white ’ands, an’ dressed
out like a country-lass, as do carry y’rself so proud-like?
Hush and I’ll tell ’ee. You be one as long
loved Love, an’ sought it vainly till, one day, ye
found it—in your own heart ... the love for a
man——”</p>

<p>“I—I love no man!” cried my lady, with a strange
vehemence.</p>

<p>“Bah!” quoth Penelope harshly, “’tis peepin’ at
me from y’r eyes, flushin’ in y’r cheek. First, ’twas
love o’ y’rself, which was a bad love, but now ...
aha, now it be love for a man! A love as shall grow
an’ grow till it be a pain ... some love be a pain,
I know ... and ’tis the only love worth ’aving!”</p>

<p>“I love no man!” repeated my lady.</p>

<p>“Shall I speak his name, mistress?”</p>

<p>“No—no!” answered my lady, a little breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Oho!” chuckled old Penelope in most witch-like
manner. “Oho! ... ‘no, no!’ quo’ she!... An’
’er so proud an’ arl! But I know, aye, ol’ Pen knows!
For I loved once when the world was younger an’
kinder.... I were tall then, and nigh prideful as
you, afore age an’ sorrow bent me an’ love humbled
me. Love? Aye, but ’twas worth the pain, for
’twas a love hath sweetened the bitter o’ the long,
weary years, an’ cheered my loneliness ... a love
as I shall tak’ wi’ me to a better place an’ find Happiness
at last, maybe—Happiness ... after s’much bitter
solitude!”</p>

<p>Suddenly the old eyes were upturned to the radiant
heaven, their fierceness was softened by the glitter
of slow-gathering, painful tears; and then, upon that
bowed and aged shoulder came a hand, a gentle hand
yet strong, for all its white delicacy; and my lady spoke
in voice Sir John had never heard from her before:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“Art so very lonely?”</p>

<p>“Lonely?” The word was a groan, and the
drooping shoulders sank lower. “I’ve been a lone
soul all my days—wi’ none to care for me since HE
died, an’ none to tak’ my part except Jarge and Sir
Hector ... the liddle children mock me ... the
women be worse! An’ I du be gettin’ that old and
weary!... Sometimes I can scarce brave it any
more!”...</p>

<p>“Wilt take me for thy friend, old Penelope?”</p>

<p>The old woman lifted white head proudly as any
person of quality might have done and stared at my
lady keenly, then reached up and patted the hand upon
her shoulder.</p>

<p>“’Tis come too late!” sighed she. “You be too
young an’ I be too old for friendship ... but I
thank ye kindly.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll suffer me to come and talk with you
sometimes, Penelope?”</p>

<p>“Why, ye see, the roof leaks, an’ the chimbley
smokes——”</p>

<p>“The more shame to Sir John Dering!” exclaimed
my lady fiercely.</p>

<p>“Aye,’twere different in the ol’ squire’s time—the
other Sir John as marched away wi’ his sojers an’
never came back ... the world was better then ...
’specially High Dering. But to-day they name me
witch, an’ a witch’s cottage bean’t no place for young
maids—’specially your sort! But since you be here,
come in an’ sit ye down—both on ye! An’ if ye’ll
wait ’till my kittle b’iles I’ll brew ye a dish o’ tea——”</p>

<p>“Tea?” exclaimed my lady.</p>

<p>“Aye, I generally tak’s a drop towards noon; it
do warm my old bones!” So saying, she led them
into the cottage and very carefully locked, bolted and
chained the door.</p>

<p>“I do this,” she explained, “because happen they
may come an’ mak’ trouble for me—sudden-like!”</p>

<p>“Who, pray?” demanded my lady indignantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>“Any fule as finds ’is cow gone dry, or ’is crop
blighted, or ’is horse off its feed, or his child in a fit....
Lord bless ’ee, child, doan’t stare so! Ye see folks
thinks I’ve ‘the evil eye’ an’ can blast ’em with a
look ... aye, but I wish I could, that I du!”</p>

<p>“And so,” continued Sir John, “they have stoned
her, set dogs on her, and threatened her with death
by water and the fire, ere now——”</p>

<p>“Aye, but the dogs be worst!” cried old Penelope,
giving the fire a savage poke. “I can’t abide
dogs!”</p>

<p>“By heaven!” exclaimed my lady in sudden
ferocity, “would I were a man!”</p>

<p>“By heaven!” retorted Sir John, “I rejoice that
you are not!”</p>

<p>“Tush!” she cried angrily, “’tis time there came a
man to High Dering!”</p>

<p>“I have thought so too!” he answered gravely.</p>

<p>“Nay, I mean a strong man—a man of action!”</p>

<p>So saying, my lady rose, contemptuous, seeming to
fill the small place with the majesty of her presence.</p>

<p>“Dear Penelope,” said she gently, “suffer me to
do that for you—I’ll lay the cloth and——”</p>

<p>“No, no!”</p>

<p>“But I say yes!”</p>

<p>“O do ye an’ arl!” exclaimed the old woman
fiercely. “This be my own cottage till they turn me
out an’ then——”</p>

<p>“Turn you out?”</p>

<p>“Aye, in two or three wiks!”</p>

<p>“You hear, sir; you hear?”</p>

<p>“I do!” answered Sir John.</p>

<p>“And when you are homeless, Penelope, what shall
you do?”</p>

<p>“Walk an’ tramp ’till I caan’t go no further, an’
then find a quiet corner to die in——”</p>

<p>“Nay, that you shall not!” cried my lady passionately.
“I will take ye—you shall come to me, I will
adopt you——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“Eh—eh!” gasped old Penelope, and very nearly
dropped her cherished Chinese teapot.</p>

<p>“You shall come to me, Penelope,” repeated my
lady, taking the teapot from her tremulous fingers.
“I shall adopt you—nay, my dear soul, never doubt
me, I mean it every word!”</p>

<p>“But ... but,” stammered old Penelope, “they
call me a witch! They ... they——”</p>

<p>“Devil take ’em!” exclaimed my lady. “I will
care for thee, Penelope! Shalt find peace and comfort
at last, thou brave soul!” And here, seeing the old
creature’s pitiful amaze, my lady stooped suddenly
and pressed warm lips on her wrinkled brow.</p>

<p>“Lord God!” exclaimed old Penelope, and sinking
into the elbow-chair, hid her face in her toil-worn
hands. And presently she spoke in voice harsh and
broken, “There be nobody ... has kissed me ...
since my dyin’ mother, long an’ long ago!”</p>

<p>“My dear soul!” said my lady, and Sir John saw
her eyes suddenly brim with tears. “My dear soul,
there is a woman shall kiss away thy sorrows if she
may.... For to-day, Penelope, thou hast found a
friend and I a—a fairy godmother! Let me kiss thee
again, godmother!”</p>

<p>Slowly old Penelope raised her head to look into
the face bowed above her.</p>

<p>“Happen I be dreamin’,” she sighed, “an’ shall
wake by an’ by—but, O child, it be good to dream—sometimes.”</p>

<span class="smaller">GIVETH SOME DESCRIPTIONS OF A TEA-DRINKING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“’Tis most excellent tea!” quoth my lady. “I
vow I have never drank better!”</p>

<p>“Arl the way from Chaney, mam.”</p>

<p>“And these beautiful dishes!”</p>

<p>“Chaney, too!” nodded old Penelope proudly.
“An’ look at my teapot! I means to tak’ it along
wi’ me when they do turn me out, though ’twill be a
bit ’ard to carry, I rackon. But ye see, mam, I——”</p>

<p>“Nay, godmother, call me Rose.”</p>

<p>“No, mam, it doan’t come easy to my tongue.”</p>

<p>“I may call you Penelope, mayn’t I?”</p>

<p>“For sure!”</p>

<p>“And fairy godmother?”</p>

<p>“Aye, though I be more witch than fairy, I rackon.”</p>

<p>“Then, godmother Penelope, pray call me Rose.”</p>

<p>“Rose, then!” she snapped.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Sir John in his pleasant voice, “you
have some message for me, Mrs. Penelope?”</p>

<p>“Gimme time, young man, gimme time! I bean’t
kissed an’ called a fairy every day, so gimme——”
She paused suddenly and seemed to listen intently,
“I rackon you’d best be goin’—both on ye!”</p>

<p>“But why, pray?” demanded my lady.</p>

<p>“Happen I’ll ha’ trouble here presently.”</p>

<p>“Then, of course, I shall stay with you!” quoth
my lady in her most determined manner, but glanced
round sharply, as upon the back door of the cottage
sounded three soft raps repeated three several times.</p>

<p>“That will be Mr. Potter, I think,” said Sir John.
“Shall I let him in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>“Since ye seem to know arl about it, young man,
ye may.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had Sir John loosed the bolts than, sure
enough, Mr. Potter slid into the room and proceeded
to lock and bolt and chain the door, further securing
it with a stout iron bar that he reached from adjacent
corner; thus busied, he spoke, albeit gasping a little
with his late exertions.</p>

<p>“They nigh ’ad me once, Pen ... but I slipped
’em ... t’other side the ... ’anging wood. But
I’ve gotten an ’are for ye ... a praper big ’un as I
took ... in Dering Park and ... by the Pize!”
he exclaimed as, turning, he espied my lady.</p>

<p>Mr. Potter was hardly himself, for his hat was gone,
his clothes were torn and stained with the mud and
green slime of damp hiding-places, while his unkempt
hair clung in elf-locks about an unshaven face, grimed
with dust and streaked with sweat; moreover,
beneath one arm he carried a short, though very
formidable bludgeon.</p>

<p>“Who is this horrid person?” demanded my lady,
and took up the boiling kettle in her defence.</p>

<p>“By Goles!” ejaculated Mr. Potter, and, eyeing her
heroic proportions and determined air, retreated to
the door.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said Sir John, intervening, “it is my joy
to present my friend, Mr. George Potter. Mr. Potter—Mrs.
Rose!”</p>

<p>“Friend?” she repeated. “Your friend? Is he a
murderer or merely a thief?”</p>

<p>“Neither, child. He is simply a friend o’ mine
temporarily embarrassed by—circumstances.”</p>

<p>Mr. Potter made a leg and touched an eyebrow in
polite salutation, and diving into the inner mysteries
of the frieze coat, brought thence a large hare, which
he laid upon the little dresser. Quoth he, “Theer ’e
be, Pen! ’E should keep ’ee goin’ for a day or so,
I rackon.”</p>

<p>“Aye, Jarge, an’ thank’ee!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“An’ now I’ll better be goin’.”</p>

<p>“What be your ’urry, lad? There be rum i’ the
cupboard an’ kittle’s a-biling.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I see it be!” answered Mr. Potter, retreating
to the door again.</p>

<p>“Then sit ’ee down, do!”</p>

<p>“Why, y’see, Pen, Oxham an’ ’is men be a-seekin’
’ereabouts, an’ I won’t ’ave ’em mak’ trouble for you
arl along on account o’ pore Potter——”</p>

<p>“Bah!” exclaimed old Penelope fiercely. “What
do I care for ’em! They can’t frutten me. So sit
ye down, Jarge.”</p>

<p>“Why, I bean’t ’ardly fit for comp’ny, Pen, and——”
Mr. Potter suddenly held his peace, and they heard a
distant shout, a clamour of voices, a growing hubbub.
“They’ve winded me, I rackon!” said he.</p>

<p>“Aye,” nodded Penelope composedly, “they’ll be
breakin’ the door in prensly! So get ye below, Jarge;
get ye down under stone.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Pen, they’ll come here sure an’ pull the
old place t’ bits, an’ if they should find me ’twould be
bad for us both! No, I’ll cut stick whiles I can,
Pen!” And, crossing to the front door, Mr. Potter
reached to draw the bolts then hesitated and stood
listening, while old Penelope peered through the lattice.</p>

<p>“Ye be too late, Jarge,” said she calmly, “there
be three or four of ’em waitin’ for ye in the road.”</p>

<p>“An’ pore Potter thought as he’d tricked ’em in
Dering Wood!” sighed Mr. Potter gloomily. “An’
if they tak’ me in your cottage, Pen, they’ll take you
’long as my accomplish——”</p>

<p>“Let ’em!” said she serenely. “But as for you,
get ’ee down under stone quick!”</p>

<p>Mr. Potter still hesitated, hearkening to the shouts
and hallooing, the awful sound of the hue and cry that
grew louder every moment.</p>

<p>“What is it?” questioned my lady, clasping her
hands, for the terror seemed all about the cottage.
“Oh, what does it mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>“Hold y’r tongue, lass!” answered Penelope.
“You’ll know soon enough, I rackon!”</p>

<p>“The witch’s cottage!” boomed a voice. “The
old hag’ll know where t’ find him, sure!” Here a
clamour of assent. “If she doan’t open the door,
burst it in!” boomed Mr. Oxham again.</p>

<p>“I be main grieved for this, Pen!” sighed Mr.
Potter, crossing to the hearth in his leisured fashion,
“but what is to be—must be!” So saying, he thrust
an arm up the wide chimney and pulled lustily at some
hidden object, whereupon was a creaking sound and
my lady shrank back, uttering a gasp of surprise to see
the broad hearthstone sink from sight and in its place
a yawning cavity.</p>

<p>“Quick, Jarge!” warned Penelope, still peering
from the lattice.</p>

<p>“If they dogs start ill-usin’ of ’ee, Pen, I be a-comin’
up!” quoth Mr. Potter, seating himself upon the floor,
his legs a-dangle in the void below. “You, Mus’
Derwent,” he continued appealingly, “you took ’er
part once afore——”</p>

<p>“And will again,” answered Sir John cheerily, “so
down with ye, man; trust me, old Penelope shall
suffer no harm.”</p>

<p>“God bless ’ee, sir!” growled Mr. Potter, and
immediately vanished, whereupon the hearthstone
rose demurely into place and became as innocent-seeming
as any in all Sussex; then, setting the
elbow-chair upon it, Penelope sat down and spread
her thin, work-worn hands to the comfort of the
fire.</p>

<p>“An’ now, my dear,” said she, “if there be any
tay left, I’d like another cup.” So, while clamour
raged without, my lady manipulated the priceless
teapot, and Sir John, noting her firm wrist and untroubled
demeanour, smiled happily.</p>

<p>And then was a tramp of feet, violent blows upon
the door, and Mr. Sturton’s voice more authoritative
than usual:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>“Penelope Haryott, open the door! ’Tis me, James
Sturton! Open the door, d’ye hear me?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I ’ears ye,” cried the old woman, “an’ I
spits!”</p>

<p>“Damned hag!—will ye open?”</p>

<p>“Galler’s-bird, no!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll break it down!”</p>

<p>“Why, then, break away, an’ a bloody end t’ye,
James Sturton!” answered old Penelope, sipping her
tea with relish.</p>

<p>A stick shivered one of the few remaining panes of
glass in the lattice, and Mr. Oxham’s voice boomed:</p>

<p>“You shall suffer for it, Pen Haryott, when us do
come in!”</p>

<p>“Bah!” she laughed in fierce derision. “I be used
to suffering!” Here the stout door shook to a fierce
blow that seemed the signal for others, for there began
a furious battering.</p>

<p>“Sit still, young man,” cried old Penelope above
the din, for Sir John had risen—“sit ye still! ’Tis a
strong door an’ should hold ’em till we ha’ finished our
tea-drinking, I rackon.”</p>

<p>“But,” answered he, as the hammering momentarily
subsided, “it seems shameful to permit them to
destroy your property——”</p>

<p>“My property!” cried she. “Mine? Lord, you
must be a gurt fool of a young man!”</p>

<p>“Howbeit,” he answered, “we will endeavour to
quiet ’em; their noise offends me.” So saying, Sir
John drew the bolts and, turning the massive key,
flung the door wide and thus came face to face with
Mr. Oxham supported by some half-score sturdy fellows
who crowded the little front garden and kept back
the throng of excited villagers.</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Mr. Oxham, recoiling a step, “so
’tis you again, is it?”</p>

<p>Sir John affably admitted the fact.</p>

<p>“We want George Potter!”</p>

<p>“You usually do, it seems.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“And we be a-comin’ into this cottage to find him!”</p>

<p>“I think not!”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Sturton pushed his way to the fore.</p>

<p>“Look’ee here, you!” quoth he, wagging bodeful
finger, “if you bean’t out o’ this in two minutes we’ll
apprehend you as the accomplice o’ this curst smuggler,
this rogue Potter as dared to fire on the King’s uniform
last night. We means to get him if we ha’ to pull
this cottage down. Are ye goin’ to let us in?”</p>

<p>“Where is your search-warrant?” demanded Sir
John.</p>

<p>“Search-warrant be damned!” roared Mr. Oxham.
“We are here to tak’ George Potter, aye—and the
old witch along wi’ him——”</p>

<p>“And I,” answered Sir John, slim hands disappearing
into coat-pockets, “am here to prevent you.”</p>

<p>The man Oxham swung up his stick, Sir John
stepped lightly back, and his hands flashed to view,
each grasping a small, silver-mounted pocket-pistol,
very arresting for all their lack of size. “Look’ee,
fellow,” quoth he, “I ha’ no particular desire for your
blood, but come one step nearer, you or any o’ your
men, and I break that man’s leg!”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe him, lads!” cried Sturton. “He’d
never dare; the law’s behind us; he’d never dare shoot;
’twould mean hanging or transportation.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Sir John; “pray step forward,
Mr. Sturton, and see for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” quoth Mr. Oxham, “you lead the way,
Sturton, an’ we’ll foller!”</p>

<p>Mr. Sturton scowled at the threatening pistol-muzzles,
at the serenely determined face behind them,
and hesitated, as well he might.</p>

<p>And then, all in a moment, Sir John found matters
taken entirely out of his hands; he saw an out-thrust,
shapely arm, felt himself pushed aside with surprising
ease, and my lady was between him and his would-be
assailants. For a moment she faced the astonished
crowd proudly contemptuous, and when she addressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
them her disdain was such that despite hot anger she
never thought to swear.</p>

<p>“Animals,” said she, “get out of my sight!”</p>

<p>For a moment was amazed silence, then rose a
murmur, an angry growl.</p>

<p>“Who be the likes o’ her to miscall the likes o’
we?” cried a voice. “She be nobody—look at ’er
gownd!”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Oxham spoke:</p>

<p>“You be a fine piece, I’ll allow, mistress, aye—fit
for a lord or a dook ye be, but your handsome looks
won’t——” Here, suddenly espying the nature of
the weapon she held, he shrank and cowered away.
“’Ware of her, Sturton!” he cried, but all too late,
for with a graceful sweep of her long arm she swung
the large pitcher she had hitherto kept hidden, discharging
its boiling contents over the huddled crowd
in a streaming deluge, whereupon arose screams,
curses, groans, a very pandemonium, as these men,
who had fronted Sir John’s pistols, retreated in wild
confusion. Reaching the road, they halted to stamp
and swear, while Mr. Oxham roared threats and
cherished scalded face, and Sturton, cursing all and
sundry, cried shame on them to “be beat by a damned
slip o’ shrewish womanhood!” to such effect that they
were presently back again more viciously threatening
than ever, though keeping well away from the tall
young Amazon who stood with pitcher recharged and
the light of battle in her eyes, strung for action, yet
supremely disdainful of them, one and all.</p>

<p>So was a momentary respite, for the men, uncertain
and a little shamefaced, hung back, despite Sturton’s
lashing tongue and Oxham’s bellowing. And then
arose warning shouts from their fellows who guarded
the roadway, a clatter of horse-hoofs and sounds of
sudden strife, whereupon Oxham’s men hastened to
join the fray. Thus the turmoil grew, while up rose
a swirling cloud of dust wherein men strove hand to
hand, a fierce hurly-burly whence ever and anon was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
heard a wild, eldritch screech of exultation. Suddenly,
high above the reeling press, two legs appeared,
very helpless legs that writhed and contorted themselves
in desperate but futile kickings ere they vanished.
Then the close-locked fray was split asunder, and
through the seething dust a gigantic form appeared,
with a man clutched helpless beneath each mighty
arm, and who paused to glare round about and note
the havoc he had wrought upon his bruised and dismayed
assailants, and to vent another fierce screech
of triumph ere he became articulate.</p>

<p>“Ye fules!” he roared. “Dinna anger me—dinna
rouse the auld Adam in me or mebbe I’ll be hurtin’
some o’ ye!”</p>

<p>Thus stood Sir Hector Lauchlan MacLean, the very
incarnation of strife, hatless and wigless, his clothes
rent and torn, his wretched captives struggling vainly
in the grasp of his arms, his lean face flushed with the
ecstasy of the moment.</p>

<p>“Wha’ stays a MacLean meets the de’il!” quoth he.
“An’ here’s MacLean the noo, an’ whaur’s the man tae
gainsay him? You, Oxham-laddie, an’ you, Sturton,
is it battle and bluidshed ye’re wantin’? If aye,
speak the worrd. If no’, get ye oot o’ Dame Haryott’s
but-an’-ben, an’ quick aboot it, for I’m fair yearnin’
for a wee mair tulzie-mulzie, y’ ken!”</p>

<p>“We’ve no quarrel wi’ you, Sir Hector,” answered
Mr. Oxham sullenly.</p>

<p>“Mair’s the peety, lad, mair’s the peety!” sighed
Sir Hector. “But we’ll no’ let a bit quarrel stand
betwixt us, man; I can fecht wi’oot any quarrel at a’
when needfu’.”</p>

<p>“We are here, sir,” explained Mr. Sturton, “to
arrest the notorious rogue and smuggler, George——”</p>

<p>“Ou aye, I ken that fine!” nodded Sir Hector.
“An’, O man, but this smugglin’ ’s an awf’ business,
I’ll no’ deny. But Penelope Haryott bides here, y’
ken, an’ she’s an auld body, stricken wi’ years, an’
auld folk lo’e peace an’ quiet! So I’m juist suggestin’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
tae ye, Oxham, ma mannie, that ye gang awa’
an’ arrest your smuggler somewhaier else. Is it aye
or no?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Sir Hector!” answered Mr. Oxham more
sullenly than ever. “And us’ll tell Lord Sayle o’ this
here business!”</p>

<p>“Good!” nodded Sir Hector, beginning in his most
pedantic English: “Pray carry him my compliments
and inform him, on my behalf, that should he experience
the burning need of a little gentlemanly satisfaction,
Sir Hector MacLean will be happy to meet
him at any time, anywhere, with broadsword or
rapier, pistol, dirk, or half-pike, right hand or left,
to suit his own convenience, and ... aye, an’ damn
him intae the bargain for a scoondrel, whateffer! An’
noo, tak’ ye’sels hence—awa’ wi’ ye or I’ll be crackin’
y’r twa thick heids taegither.”</p>

<p>Thus stood Sir Hector, indeed a very Hector,
Achilles and Ajax rolled into one, his two captives
still in durance, his brow a little sad as he watched
the enemy’s retreat. Then, becoming aware of his
helpless prisoners, he loosed them and patted each
dazed fellow upon tousled crown.</p>

<p>“Losh,” quoth he, “I fair disremembered ye!
Rin awa’, laddies, rin awa’ an’ dinna forget Hector
Lauchlan MacLean.”</p>

<p>And now it was that he felt a touch upon his arm
and, turning, came face to face with my lady.</p>

<p>“Save ’s a’,” he exclaimed, “’tis Rose!”</p>

<p>“Herself, dear Sir Hector!” she answered and,
smiling, reached him both her hands. But instead of
clasping them, he clapped his own to his wigless head
and stood utterly discomfited and abashed.</p>

<p>“Hoot-toot,” quoth he, “I’m no’ a fit sicht for a
lassie’s een—look awa’, Rose, look awa’! Rab!” he
roared, “O Rabbie-man, bring me ma wig. Rin,
laddie, rin!”</p>

<p>“Here, sir!” answered Robert, stepping from the
shadow of the hedge with the object in question,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
which Sir Hector snatched and donned hastily; then,
facing about, he bowed ceremoniously.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said he, “I rejoice to see thee safe back.”</p>

<p>“O Sir Hector,” cried she, reaching him her hands
again, “thou’rt indeed a man ’tis joy to see, a man
of action, of deeds not words—and marvellous strong.
You fight as if you loved it!”</p>

<p>Sir Hector’s cheek flushed and his eye glistened.</p>

<p>“Yet ilka joy hath its sorrow, child!” he sighed.
“Wull ye look at ma coat?”</p>

<p>“I vow it becomes you vastly, torn so!”</p>

<p>“Aye, but ’tis my third best!” he answered
gloomily. “An’ though mebbe ’tis somewhat worn
an’ weary wi’ hard service an’ length o’ days, ’tis an
auld friend, y’ ken!”</p>

<p>“Then do but bring thine old friend within doors
and I’ll cobble him for thee,” said my lady; and side
by side they crossed the trampled garden to the
cottage, while ex-Corporal Robert stared after them,
rubbing his square chin thoughtfully. Then, being
left thus to his own devices, he went back to her who
stood awaiting him shyly in the shadow of the tall
hedge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br />
<span class="smaller">IN WHICH SIR JOHN RECEIVES A WARNING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Sir John, watching the retreat of their discomfited
assailants, and lost in admiration of
Sir Hector’s might and prowess, was roused by a
touch, and beheld old Penelope, who, finger on lip,
led him to a dark corner whence a narrow, precipitous
stair mounted, up which she climbed, beckoning him
to follow. Thus Sir John presently found himself in
a small chamber bright with sun, the shattered panes
of its wide lattice very neatly mended with oiled
paper; and, glancing about, he marvelled within
himself, for the place wore an air of refinement wholly
unexpected, from the narrow carved bedstead to the
few heavily framed pictures on the walls. And she
herself seemed to have undergone some subtle change,
for, when she spoke, her voice was less harsh and her
dialect less pronounced:</p>

<p>“Here, young master, is where old Pen, the witch,
sleeps a-nights, but very often lays awake an’ has her
truthful dreams and sees visions of what was, and is,
and will be. For when all the world sleeps an’ only
she is waking because she so wills, then the thoughts
of the sleepin’ multitudes gather about her an’ she
sees an’ knows an’ has her dreams. So, sit ye down,
young master—so! Now mark what I says! The
Downs hereabouts be full o’ souls, spirits o’ folk as
died long an’ long ago; their bodies be dust, ages old,
but their spirits do live—I can feel ’em arl about me
when I tramp so far, the souls o’ the Strange Folk
as nobody remembers or knows aught about ...
there be pits where they lived an’ graves where their
dust lies buried ... ’tis the dust o’ the unnumbered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
dead as goes to make the sweet grass, an’ herbs, an’ flowers
... folk as lived an’ loved an’ died, ages agone, folk as
did good and evil in their day, but the silent hills do
keep arl their secrets fast hid—’specially Windover!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Sir John softly, though his eyes grew
suddenly keen. “Pray, why Windover?”</p>

<p>“Because ’tis o’ Windover as you’ve been thinkin’
so much.”</p>

<p>“Faith and that’s true enough!” he answered.</p>

<p>“The Long Man o’ Wilmington do ha’ seen many a
fearsome thing in his length o’ days, but he’ll never tell
naun ... there be a patch o’ grass on Windover as hath
been warmed wi’ a man’s life-blood ere now, but Windover’s
kep’ the secret an’ will do till the end o’ time.”</p>

<p>“You mean the cruel murder of Roger Hobden,
I think?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I do.”</p>

<p>“Then, Penelope, if you know any tittle of truth that
may help discover his murderers, I beg you speak.”</p>

<p>“His murderers, young sir?”</p>

<p>“Aye, there were three concerned in it, as I imagine,
and yet ’tis but imagination, for proof there is none ...
so if you know, or can aid me——”</p>

<p>“No,” she cried fiercely—“no! And wherefore
mix y’self in the black business—why?”</p>

<p>“For many reasons,” he answered thoughtfully.
“Mayhap because I am an idler and the matter
puzzles me, mayhap because I think Justice hath been
cheated too long, or mayhap because I have reasons
to suspect——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” she cried. “Name no names! What I
know I do know, but ’twouldn’t be no good to your
court lawyers; they would but laugh at an old woman’s
dreams.... But for yourself ... ah, for yourself,
young master, let be—let be, I tell ’ee!” And,
reaching out suddenly, she seized his arm and shook it
so that he wondered at the strength of her aged fingers.
“Let be!” she repeated, her voice sinking to a pleading
whisper. “The Downs hereaways has many secrets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
an’ who be you t’ expect to learn what they bean’t
nowise willin’ to tell? So ha’ done, young sir, you
bean’t old enough to die yet awhile——”</p>

<p>“To die?” repeated Sir John, startled by her tone
and the fixed intensity of her look.</p>

<p>“Die!” She nodded. “Them as seeks murderers
seeks death, for Murder will murder to hide murder.”</p>

<p>“And you think that in attempting to solve this
mystery I run a certain danger, Penelope?”</p>

<p>“I know it!” she answered.</p>

<p>“None the less, I feel I must attempt it ... the
poor girl vanished, you’ll remember, and was never
heard of more.”</p>

<p>“An’ never will be!”</p>

<p>“And,” said he, frowning, “there may be other
such hateful doings.”</p>

<p>“For sure!” She nodded again. “Hundreds—thousands,
’till the world grows better!”</p>

<p>“Shall I succeed in this quest?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Wherefore not, Penelope?”</p>

<p>“Because you’ll tak’ up wi’ a better thing!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Love!”</p>

<p>“Hum!” quoth Sir John, and became thoughtful
awhile. “Shall I succeed in my love, think ye?”
he questioned at last.</p>

<p>“Only when Hope be dead.”</p>

<p>“Penelope,” said he, smiling as he leaned to touch
her clasped hands, “how much of all this is pure
guesswork?”</p>

<p>“Aye me,” she sighed, “you be tur’ble like your
father afore ye——”</p>

<p>“My”—Sir John sat up and blinked—“my father,
say you?”</p>

<p>“Aye, sure,” she sighed; “he would never believe,
never be warned! Happen if he had—ah, if only he
had, ’tis like he wouldn’t ha’ died so young, away off
in the cruel French wars, Sir John.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>“You—you know me?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Aye, indeed, Sir John!”</p>

<p>“When did you recognise me?”</p>

<p>“’Twas when ye picked up my cabbage for me,
sir.”</p>

<p>“And how did you know?”</p>

<p>“Happen ’twas y’r eyes ... or a memory o’ the
years ... or happen because o’ my dreams, an’ I ...
just knew.”</p>

<p>Sir John, leaning back in his chair, viewed her with
a new respect.</p>

<p>“Penelope,” said he, “thou’rt a strange and wonderful
woman!”</p>

<p>“So they stone me, sir, an’ call me ‘witch’!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” he sighed, “because the vulgar cannot
love anything different to themselves.... And you
knew my father?”</p>

<p>“In a better day, long an’ long ago!” she answered,
lifting her head proudly and holding his regard with
her strangely bright old eyes. “He was a great and
noble gentleman!” So saying, she rose suddenly,
and, drawing a small key from her bosom, opened a
drawer and took thence two miniatures, one of which
she studied awhile with bowed head ere she handed
it to Sir John; it was a thing of exquisite artistry,
set within a gold frame; the picture of a manly face,
square-chinned, firm-lipped, but with eyes soft and
tender as a woman’s.</p>

<p>“I never saw this picture of my father, Penelope.”</p>

<p>“Nobody has!” she answered. And now she gave
him the other picture, whose gold, strangely cut and
battered, framed a face of extraordinary beauty—black-haired,
deep-eyed, low-browed, full and vivid
of mouth—the face of a girl passionate with life and
eager youth, yet dominated by an expression of
resolute strength and courage.</p>

<p>“Why, Penelope!” said he in awed voice—“O
Penelope, this—this was yourself!”</p>

<p>“Aye, that was me,” she answered; “’twas ’ow I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
looked long ago ... when the world was younger
an’ kinder.”</p>

<p>“And why is the case so battered? See, the gold
is cut quite through in one place!”</p>

<p>“Aye, so it be!” said old Penelope very softly, and
stood with the miniature in her hand, turning it over
and over in her bony fingers and on her face a light
that was not wholly of the sun. Then, with a sudden
gesture, she turned and locked the portraits away.</p>

<p>“Hark!” said she; “d’ye hear aught?” From
somewhere beneath arose a fearsome puffing and
blowing, accompanied by a ceaseless splashing. “That
be Jarge Potter a-washin’ hisself!” she explained.
“Which do mean as him an’ Sir Hector will be wantin’
their hot grog; they never fancies tea.”</p>

<p>“Penelope,” said Sir John, “will you keep my
identity secret a while longer?”</p>

<p>“Why, for sure, Mus’ Derwent!” she answered,
and then suddenly caught his hand, holding it fast
while eyes and voice pleaded anew: “Let be, Sir John!
Let blood answer blood, but keep you out of it....”</p>

<p>“Nay, Penelope,” he answered gently, “I would
remind you that poor Roger Hobden was my horse-boy
years ago and taught me to steal apples——”</p>

<p>“And I bid ye let be!” she whispered passionately.
“The evil as they wrought shall foller them as did it!
What if they be never dragged to Justice, Roger will be
avenged, one day.... I know it, so keep you clear
o’ them, sir, for your sake and your dead father’s!”</p>

<p>Sir John was silent awhile then, stooping reverently,
raised those old, work-roughened hands that clasped
his so eagerly, and touched them with his lips.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she sighed; and feeling how she trembled,
he looked up to see her eyes brimming with tears.
“Ah, sir,” she whispered, “’tis almost as I were young
again an’ the world a better place!”</p>

<p>“Pray heaven it shall be so!” he answered very
gravely and, opening the door, followed her down the
dark and narrow stair.</p>

<span class="smaller">BEING A CHAPTER OF NO GREAT CONSEQUENCE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>My lady, seated between Sir Hector, very conscious
of his shirt-sleeves, and Mr. Potter, fresh and
assured of himself by reason of his late ablutions, held
up the garment she had been mending, and viewed
the result of her labours with coldly disparaging eye.</p>

<p>“I fear ’tis very clumsily done, sir,” said she.</p>

<p>“Nay, ’pon my soul,” answered Sir Hector ponderously
gallant. “I protest ’tis of needlework the most
excellent! My old coat will be endeared to me for the
... the sake o’ your bonny, white fingers! An’ noo,
gin ye’re finished wi’t, I’ll get in till’t, for ’tis no juist
proper tae sit here afore ye in my sark, ye ken....
Aha, Johnnie, is she no’ a graund lassie, as apt wi’
needle as wi’ boilin’ watter? A fine, sonsy lass——”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” answered Sir John gravely, “she is as
up-standing and down-sitting a wench as——”</p>

<p>“Tush!” cried my Lady Herminia, flushing.
“There is your ill-cobbled coat, Sir Hector. And now,
I’ll be going.”</p>

<p>“Whaur to, lassie?”</p>

<p>“Home to my aunt, sir.”</p>

<p>“Aunt?” repeated Sir Hector at a loss, “but ’twas
your grandmother last time, I mind.”</p>

<p>“And to-day ’tis my aunt, sir. And she a lone
widow.”</p>

<p>“Aunt? Widow?” quoth Sir Hector. “Why
then, ’tis no’ for the sake o’ a puir, auld, solitary, worn
an’ woefu’ soldier-body wi’ ane leg i’ the grave as ye’re
here, Rose? ’Tis no’ for the sake o’ lonesome Hector
MacLean, whateffer?”</p>

<p>“Indeed but it is, sir!” she smiled. “To cook and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
care, and tend and mend for him. I shall come and
keep house for you every day.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but your aunt, the widow-body—she’ll be
the fly in the ointment, lassie——”</p>

<p>“Indeed and she’s no such thing, sir, as you shall
see, for I mean to bring her with me sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Hoot-toot—and she a widow? Na’, na’, lassie,
I’ll be safer wi’ Wully Tamson.”</p>

<p>“Sir Hector MacLean,” quoth my lady with her
most determined air, “since you are such a very old,
poor, solitary soldier-body, I intend to do my best
for your future happiness ... with my aunt’s aid.”</p>

<p>“Save’s a’!” gasped Sir Hector, “an’ she a widow!”</p>

<p>“My aunt will, I hope, assist in my labour for your
comfort and welfare.”</p>

<p>“Aweel!” sighed Sir Hector, “I can run as fast
as ony man. I’ve braw, lang legs, y’ ken.”</p>

<p>“Though one of ’em is in the grave, sir!” she
reminded him. Here, at a sign from Penelope, my
lady curtsied demurely and followed the old woman
out of the room.</p>

<p>“Losh!” exclaimed Sir Hector, “yon Rose hath
an air aboot her that gi’es a cautious man tae think.”</p>

<p>“Very much so!” answered Sir John. “As you
once said, she is not exactly an ordinary lass.”</p>

<p>“An’ noo, Geordie man,” said Sir Hector, lowering his
voice, “’twas a mighty ill business yon, last nicht!”</p>

<p>“Why, I dunno, sir,” answered Mr. Potter, stirring
his grog thoughtfully, “we brought away every tub
an’ bale—arl safe stowed, they be.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but the shooting, man, the bluidshed!”</p>

<p>“Naun so bad, sir—though poor Will Burgess took
a musket-ball through ’is leg.”</p>

<p>“An’ the sojers, Geordie? Nine sojers an’ twa o’
the coastguard desp’ret wounded! O man,’twas
awfu’ ... an’ if ane o’ them should dee ... ’twould
be noose an’ gibbet, y’ ken!”</p>

<p>Mr. Potter smiled dreamily, and was his most guileless
self as he answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“They wunt die, sir—nary a one on ’em! They’ll
be up an’ about again by now—though salt be apt to
sting, an’ likewise smart a bit, d’ye see——”</p>

<p>“Salt?” exclaimed Sir Hector.</p>

<p>“Rock-salt, sir,” nodded Mr. Potter placidly. “I
charged arl our pieces wi’ liddle lumps o’ rock-salt
as couldn’t ’ardly ’arm a babby noo-born.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” cried Sir Hector fervently. “O
Geordie man, I’ve hardly blinked an e’e the nicht for
worry—and now—salt! Man, I fair admire at ye—salt!
Geordie man, gi’e’s a grup o’ ye hond!” And
Sir Hector laughed suddenly and was immediately
solemn again. “John an’ Geordie,” he continued,
“when Dumbrell’s Ann, thinkin’ they meant harm
to old Penelope, came running to fetch me hither, I
was upon my knees wrestling in prayer that no lives
should be spilled and none of the lads taken, for if so,
I, being equally guilty, was determined to give myself
up and suffer with ’em. And as I prayed, John and
George, I cam’ to the determination that I would be
done wi’ free-trading henceforth, whilk determination
I mean to abide by—amen!”</p>

<p>“I be glad to hear it, sir!” nodded Mr. Potter.
“You be too ’igh-strung for it, I rackon. Leave it
to us as be born to it, same as our grandfeäthers was.”</p>

<p>“And look’ee, John an’ Geordie, a’ the siller I have
had by it—aye, every penny, I have spent on good
works, and all that remains is yon lugger the <i>True
Believer</i>, and that, Geordie man, I’m giving tae
yourself!”</p>

<p>“What—what, me, sir?” gasped Mr. Potter, rising
suddenly from his chair. “You ... akerchally
gimme the <i>True Believer</i>.... Me, Sir Hector?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I do, George. She’s yours, every plank and bolt,
every rope and spar.... And here’s my hand on’t!”</p>

<p>“But,” stammered Mr. Potter, hesitating, “but
what o’ Sharkie Nye, sir? My comrade Sharkie as
ha’ sailed her so bold an’ true, blow fair or foul?
What o’ Sharkie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>“Well, what o’ him, man?”</p>

<p>“Why, I think, sir, if it be arl the same to you, I’d
be more ’appier in my mind-like if you made Sharkie
my partner, sir, share an’ share, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Geordie Potter,” quoth Sir Hector, “gi’e’s your
hand again. Your sentiments, George, do ye infinite
honour, and I’m prood to ca’ ye freend.... Forbye,
ye’re a rascally smugglin’-body an’ law-breaker,
Geordie, whilk as an elder an’ respectable citizen I
haud tae be an immoral an’ damnable practice. Faith,
George, ’tis well to be free o’ the sin that I may condemn
it in others. But look’ee, George, I hear that
the man Sayle is like a madman after last nicht’s
business, and vows to take ye and make an example
of ye, which means—well——”</p>

<p>“The gallers!” said Mr. Potter, reaching for his
grog.</p>

<p>“Consequently, George, sic’ influence as I possess—whilk
is sma’—and a’ my money—whilk is no’ sae
muckle as I could wish—I will joyfully adventure to
get ye safe awa’! Our first conseederation must be
tae get ye ower tae France.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but wherefore France, sir?”</p>

<p>“Ye’ll be safe there, man.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe, sir, but I can’t speak the lingo, d’ye see,
an’ I dunno as I like furrineers; ’sides, sir, I’ve made
my plans to bide nice an’ quiet in Alfriston——”</p>

<p>“But, ye muckle fule,” cried Sir Hector, “ye ken
the man Sayle means tae hunt ye doon?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I do, sir; this be why I’ll bide along in Alfriston;
poor Potter’ll be safest theer. Lord bless
’ee, there bean’t a Sussex man, woman nor child as
would give Potter away! An’ there’s plenty o’ hiding-places
I knaws on wheer nobody will never find poor
Potter nowhen an’ nohow——” Here Mr. Potter
paused to drink as my lady reappeared; she, taking
her leave forthwith, Sir John did the same, and together
they stepped forth into the sunshine.</p>

<span class="smaller">TELLETH HOW SIR JOHN DERING WENT A-WOOING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Upon the Down a soft wind met them, a gentle
breath sweet with wild thyme and fresh with
ocean, a wind that touched them like a caress; insomuch
that my lady removed hat and cap the better
to feel it, and, sinking upon the smooth, turfy bank
beside the path, sat to behold the beauties of teeming
earth and radiant heaven, yet very conscious of him
who stood beside her, wherefore she presently bade
him be seated. Thus, side by side, they remained
awhile, and never a word between them.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said he at last, “most sweet and fragrant
maid, thou canst be so nobly kind, so tender, so brave
and womanly that there be times love doth so enthral
me, I would thou hadst never known Herminia.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir! And is Herminia so bitter, so hard,
so cowardly, so altogether evil?”</p>

<p>“She is—Herminia!”</p>

<p>“And you,” cried she, ablaze with sudden anger,
“what are you, despite your foolish play-acting, but
that same ‘Wicked Dering’ whose name is a byword—even
here!”</p>

<p>“So it is, child, that I would be the good John
Derwent a little longer, for thy sake and my sake.
For as John Derwent I do so love thee, my Rose, I
would John Dering had never been. In John Derwent
is all John Dering’s better self ... to reverence thee
with such a love that, yearning to possess thee, scarce
dare touch thy hand.” As he spoke, his voice took
on a deeper note, his pale cheek flushed, and in his eyes
shone a light she had never seen there before; and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
beholding him thus moved, her breath quickened and
she glanced away lest he should read the triumph
in her face.</p>

<p>“Can such love truly be?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>“So long as thou art Rose,” he answered.</p>

<p>“And what o’ poor Herminia?”</p>

<p>“Do but love me, Rose, and I will strive to love her
for thy dear sake.”</p>

<p>“Will this be so hard a matter? Must you strive
so extremely?” she questioned, and glanced at him
over her shoulder, languorous-eyed, vivid lips up-curving,
conscious of and assured in her beauty; and,
reading this look, he laughed a little bitterly.</p>

<p>“O Coquetry!” he exclaimed, “that turn o’ the
neck and shoulder, that languishing droop o’ the eyes
become you vastly.... Egad, I protest you are
monstrous bewitching so, my Lady Herminia!”</p>

<p>At this she flushed angrily and knit black brows at
him.</p>

<p>“Faith, sir,” she retorted, “by your vast knowledge
o’ feminine arts I perceive you to be merely Sir John
Dering!”</p>

<p>“Who is extreme hungry!” he added. “And there
doth await him a Sir Loin o’ beef—hot! So, shall we
go on, my lady?”</p>

<p>On they went accordingly, my lady with head
proudly averted, and yet he knew her eyes were tearful,
but, noting how passionately her white hand clenched
itself, knew these for tears of anger only.</p>

<p>“Alas,” sighed he at last, “to-day poor John
Derwent’s wooing doth not prosper, it seems. Love
hath fled awhile on soaring pinions.”</p>

<p>“I never hated you more!” said she in low, steady
voice.</p>

<p>“Wouldst break thy John’s heart, girl?”</p>

<p>To this she deigned no answer; but when he had
repeated the question three or four times with as
many different modulations, she broke out angrily:</p>

<p>“Aye, I would—I would, if ever I find it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>“Couldst be so cruel, child?” he questioned lightly;
and then, more seriously, “Could you stoop to such
baseness? I wonder!”</p>

<p>“Nay,” she retorted bitterly, “’twere impossible!
You have no heart ... never did have ... never will!”</p>

<p>“And yet it beats for thee, Rose. Reach me thy
hand and feel.”</p>

<p>“Then ’tis the heart of a stock-fish!” she cried.
“Cold, cold—infinitely cold and sluggish!”</p>

<p>“Stock-fish!” he repeated mournfully—“O ye gods—a
stock-fish! Alas, sweet soul, what strange mistake
is here? A stock-fish. I that am by nature so ardent
yet so humble, of impulses so kindly, of passions so
fiery, of sentiments so very infinite tender! I that
am thy predestined mate, thy man——”</p>

<p>“Aye, thou,” she cried fiercely—“thou that art
no more than a fine-gentlemanly thing as humble as
Lucifer, as kindly as an east wind, as fiery as a lump
of lead, as tender as that savage monster who nigh
broke my wrists for me!”</p>

<p>“Gad’s my life, child,” said he, noting her flashing
eyes and glowing cheek, “thy so splendid theme
endows thee with new splendour, thou handsome
wench! Though thou dost sadly embarrass thy
modest John——”</p>

<p>“Would I might, indeed!”</p>

<p>“But ’tis very well thou shouldst justly appreciate
me as well before as after marriage! And now, for
thy poor, pretty wrists——”</p>

<p>“Why are you here, Sir John, wasting yourself in
the country?” she demanded mockingly. “Your
true place is that same heartless, selfish world o’ modish
idleness whence you came! What do you here among
these kindly Sussex folk who, at the least, live to some
purpose? Why are you here, you who live for no
purpose but yourself?”</p>

<p>“Mayhap,” he answered, “’tis because you once
minded me o’ the scabious flowers, child. See where
they bloom all around us, sweet things! Do not tread too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
hastily, Herminia, lest you crush and end their blooming.
Haste not so, for here is a stile for you to climb, and
yonder, bosomed i’ the green, is Alfriston spire.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I thank heaven!” cried she.</p>

<p>“And wherefore thy so fervent gratitude, child?”</p>

<p>“To be rid of thy hated presence!”</p>

<p>“Ah, Rose,” he sighed. “Alas, Herminia, how
heavy thy foot is! See this poor flower you trample—’tis
my heart!” And speaking, he stooped, put by
her foot very gently, and plucked one of the scabious
flowers she had trodden; fingering it tenderly, he
placed it in her hand. “Take it, child!” he sighed;
“cherish it for its own sweet sake. And for me and
my so hated presence, I will deliver you, here and
now.... But first, thy poor, pretty wrists? Show
’em to me!”</p>

<p>“No!” she answered; “never to you, Sir John!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, child, ’tis thy Derwent pleadeth, thy John
o’ Gentleness.... Suffer me to see!” And, taking
her hands, he lifted them whether she would or no.</p>

<p>“I see no wounds,” quoth he, “nor mark or bruise;
and yet who am I to judge the pretty things? And
if they endured hurt, let this witness my sorrow.”
So saying, he stooped and kissed them tenderly.
“Thus, sweet Rose, thy Derwent leaveth thee. Now,
had I been the ‘Wicked Dering’ and thou the proud
Lady Barrasdaile, it had been ... thy hands, thine
arms, thy lips ... thy very self! And now, farewell
awhile, my Rose o’ love.”</p>

<p>Saying which, Sir John bared his head, gave her his
hand across the stile, and seating himself thereon
watched her wistfully as she hurried away.</p>

<p>But, being hidden from his view, my lady paused
to glance at her wrists, flushing as though she felt his
lips there yet; and finding she still held his scabious
flower, tossed it angrily away, but, marking where it
fell, took it up again, and having throned it amid the
laces of her bodice, went her way, slow of foot and with
eyes a-dream.</p>

<span class="smaller">WHICH, AMONG OTHER SMALL MATTERS, TELLETH OF A SNUFF-BOX</span></h2>

</div>

<p>And now ensued days wherein Sir John seemingly
idled, the Corporal took mysterious journeys
both a-horse and afoot, and my Lady Herminia busied
herself upon Sir Hector’s comfort; for, having visited
his cottage and being horrified by his ideas of “homeliness,”
she prepared for immediate action—that is to say,
with lovely head tied up in a kerchief (laced cap, ringlets
and all) against such accidentals as spiders, cobwebs and
dust, she armed herself with a mop and Mr. William
Thompson with soap, water and scrubbing-brush, and
forthwith set about cleansing the Augean Stables.</p>

<p>Accoutred thus, she was directing the floor-washing
operations of Mr. Thompson in the small, tiled kitchen
when Sir Hector ventured to open the door, whereupon
Mr. Thompson, hitherto awed to dumb submission by
my lady’s imperious presence, cast down his scrubbing-brush
and lifted his voice in wailing protest:</p>

<p>“Sir ’Ector—O Sir ’Ector, will ’ee look at oi! She’s
’ad me ’ere on me knees, a-scrubbin’ an’ a-sloshin’,
this hower an’ more, she ’ave! On me marrer-bones,
sir! Crool it be! Sir ’Ector, if you ’ave an ’eart,
say a word for oi!”</p>

<p>“William Thompson,” quoth my lady, “William
Thompson—scrub.”</p>

<p>“Sir ’Ector—say a word!”</p>

<p>“Losh, Wully man, whaur’ll be the use? Ye ken
vera weel ’tis no fau’t o’ mine. Ye ken vera weel I
lo’e tae be hamely——”</p>

<p>“Sir Hector—silence!” commanded my lady.</p>

<p>“Eh, but, Rose, puir Wully an’ me are no used tae
sic awfu’——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“Enough, sir!”</p>

<p>“But, O lassie, ye’re fair washin’ me oot o’ hoose
an’ hame——”</p>

<p>“Then begone, sir, and leave us to finish.”</p>

<p>“But Guid save us a’, d’ye no——”</p>

<p>“Sir Hector,” cried my lady, with a flourish of her
mop, “go!”</p>

<p>Sir Hector went. Being in his small parlour, he
glanced yearningly upon the unwashed crockery littering
the table, from this to the dusty riding-boots upon
the mantel-shelf and, sweeping a heterogeneous collection
of small oddments from the elbow-chair to the
floor, sat down with his feet among the long-dead
ashes that cumbered the hearth, sighing for that
spirit of homely comfort that was, even then, being
washed and swept out of his ken.</p>

<p>And thus Sir John found him, a desolate soul,
huddled disconsolately over a cheerless hearth, his
peruke over one mournful eye, the very picture of woe.</p>

<p>“Hark till her, John!” quoth he dolefully. “O
man, ’tis fair heartrendin’! Hark till yon brushin’ an’
scrubbin’!”</p>

<p>“Ah, so you have a woman to clean the place for
you at last, Hector!”</p>

<p>“A wumman, d’ye say? Man, she’s no’ an
ordinary wumman.... Wull ye hark till her!”</p>

<p>“William Thompson,” cried a sweet, albeit stern
voice, “this corner is not even wetted ... scrub it!”</p>

<p>“Rose!” exclaimed Sir John.</p>

<p>“Hersel’!” sighed Sir Hector. “Can ye no reason wi’
her, John, if ’tis only for the sake o’ puir Wully Tamson?”</p>

<p>“Not for worlds, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Then what’ll I dae, Johnnie?”</p>

<p>“Come a-walking.”</p>

<p>“Na, na; I’ve no’ the sperrit, John.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve the legs, Hector.” So saying, Sir
John straightened his old friend’s wig, reached him his
hat and, taking his arm, led him out into the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Whaur awa’, Johnnie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I promised to visit Mr. Pym, the painter.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I ken him fine; wi’ rod or gun there’s nane
to equal him.”</p>

<p>They found Mr. Pym busied in his garden, who,
perceiving his visitors, laid by his spade and hastened
to make them welcome; the better to perform which,
he brought them into the house and vanished to find
the wherewithal to refresh them, only to return empty-handed
and disconsolate:</p>

<p>“Sirs,” quoth he, “the devil is in it for my brandy
is out!” And, being at a loss, he sought the aid of
his daughter. “Elsie!” he called. “Elsie!”</p>

<p>A jingle of keys, a light step and Mistress Pym
appeared, her dainty, print gown girt about slender
middle by a cincture whence hung reticule and housewifely
keys, her face framed in snowy mob-cap and
remarkable for a pair of handsome eyes.</p>

<p>“Girl,” exclaimed the painter, “my brandy’s out!”</p>

<p>Mistress Pym faced the so grave situation entirely
undismayed:</p>

<p>“I told you ’twas so, days agone, sir,” she answered
serenely. “We’ve naught left in the house save my
ginger wine.”</p>

<p>“Then that must serve,” quoth her sire. “Bring
it, a heaven’s name!”</p>

<p>Lightly she went and lightly she was back and,
steady of hand, filled the three glasses. Sir John
eyed the liquor a little askance but tasted it bravely,
and glanced at his young hostess.</p>

<p>“Your own making, Mistress Pym?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” she nodded. “’Twould be better were
it older, but father never lets it keep long enough.”</p>

<p>“And small wonder!” answered Sir John, bowing.
“Mistress Pym, I drink to your eyes, for sure there
be few to match ’em in the South Country.” So
saying, he drank and wished his glass had been larger.
Thereupon Mistress Pym curtsied to them and jingled
away about her multifarious duties.</p>

<p>“Yon’s a braw wife for some lucky man, I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
thinkin’!” quoth Sir Hector. “There’s looks till her,
an’, O man, but she’s a bonny cook whateffer! ’Tis a
graund thing when a lass can appeal tae a man’s heid,
an’ heart, an’ stomach, y’ ken.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pym,” said Sir John as, the ginger wine having
made a duly deliberate end, they rose to depart,
“you mentioned, I mind, the first time we met, the
murder of a man on Windover.”</p>

<p>“I did, sir; the cruel assassination of Roger Hobden—a
black business that was never cleared up and never
will be.”</p>

<p>“Had you any suspicions at the time?”</p>

<p>“Suspicions, sir? Remembering Lord Sayle and the
unholy doings in that solitary house of his, I suspected
every one beneath its roof, from Lord Sayle down.”</p>

<p>“Losh, man!” exclaimed Sir Hector, “ye’ve a
graund gift o’ suspeecioning.”</p>

<p>“And suppose I have, sir?” demanded the painter
argumentatively. “There is little of good in ’Friston
Manor, and evil begetteth evil. And Sayle is a law
unto himself, with bullies at hand to work his wicked
purposes.”</p>

<p>“Whisht, man!” exclaimed Sir Hector. “Ye’ll no
be suggestin’——”</p>

<p>“And why not, sir? Doth the man’s rank place
him above suspicion?”</p>

<p>“Never heed father, Sir Hector,” said Mistress Pym
at this moment, leaning in at the open door; “he doth
but seek an argument——”</p>

<p>“Mistress,” quoth the painter, “mind your
business!” Whereat Mistress Pym laughed and
jingled away again.</p>

<p>“Pym—man,” said Sir Hector, “his lordship is no’
juist an archangel nor yet a seraphim, but ye’ll no’
be suspectin’ a man o’ his quality wad stoop tae
murder a country lad o’ no condition.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, Sir Hector, I say he would stoop
to anything.”</p>

<p>“There was never any incriminating evidence found,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
I believe, sir?” inquired Sir John. “No clue of any
kind discovered?”</p>

<p>“None of importance. Though I did find a thing
on the footpath that runs above the ‘Long Man,’ near
where the crime was committed—a thing I felt it my
duty to show to the law officers and was laughed at
for my pains.... I have it here somewhere.” And
the painter turned to a small, carved press in a corner
where stood two or three fishing-rods in company
with a musket and a birding-piece.</p>

<p>“What kind o’ thing, Pym?” inquired Sir Hector.</p>

<p>“A snuff-box,” answered the painter, opening a
drawer and turning over a collection of small fossils,
flint arrow-heads, and the like.</p>

<p>“A gowd snuff-box, Pym?”</p>

<p>“Nay, ’twas of horn—a poor thing! Ah, here
’tis!” And he held out a clumsy horn snuff-box of
battered and villainous appearance. Sir John took
it, turned it this way and that, opened and sniffed
delicately at its empty interior, and finally carrying it
to the light, fell to studying it anew.</p>

<p>“Now, Pym man,” said Sir Hector, “if yon had
been gold or enamel, or even siller, it might perchance
justify your suspeecions; but whaur’s the man o’
quality would carry a thing the like o’ that?”</p>

<p>“There, sir,” answered the painter dogmatically,
“there I take issue with ye. If that box be evidence,
which I deny, mark ye—’tis precisely the kind o’ thing
your man o’ quality would purposefully leave that its
very poverty might set inquiring minds on a false
scent. I further maintain, sir, that——”</p>

<p>“Nay, Sir Hector,” laughed Mistress Pym, leaning
in at the open lattice at this moment, her hands full of
fresh-gathered flowers, “do but take father’s side o’
the question and he will immediately take yours to
keep the argument a-going.”</p>

<p>“Child,” quoth the painter, sternly grim, “I smell
your bread a-burning!”</p>

<p>“Sir,” she answered, throwing a flower at him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
“thou’rt mighty sharp-nosed this morning, for ’tis
not yet in the oven!”</p>

<p>“An’ there’s for ye, man!” chuckled Sir Hector
as she jingled away once more.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pym, would you pray lend me this box for a
few days?” inquired Sir John.</p>

<p>“Nay, take it, sir,” answered the painter, “if the sorry
thing hath any interest for you, take it and welcome.”</p>

<p>Murmuring his thanks, Sir John slipped it into his
pocket; and shortly after, bidding Mr. Pym adieu,
they left him to his gardening.</p>

<p>“Yon Pym-lassie,” quoth Sir Hector as they walked,
“is like a bagpipes——”</p>

<p>“Never in the world, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Aye, John; she’s sweet as a bagpipes, whilk, as a’
the warld kens, is the sweetest and maist soothin’ of
a’ instruments! ’Tis a muckle woefu’ wight Pym’ll
be if ever she marries, I’m thinkin’! But, Johnnie,
why for did ye want yon snuff-box?”</p>

<p>“Because I think I can find the man who lost it.”</p>

<p>“Losh, man! An’ suppose ye can, what then?”</p>

<p>“Why then, Hector, I think my Lord Sayle will
cease from hunting smugglers.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Sayle? Man, what d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“Time will show——”</p>

<p>“Aye, but meanwhile, John, d’ye mean to say ye
think——”</p>

<p>“That a mug of Mr. Bunkle’s gumboo will go very
happily with Mistress Pym’s excellent wine, so——”</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” exclaimed Sir Hector; and
together they entered the hospitable portal of the
‘Market Cross Inn,’ where they were met by the cheery
Mr. Bunkle, who ushered them as honoured guests
into his five-doored holy of holies.</p>

<p>“Do you gin’men ’appen to ha’ seed the bill as
they’ve printed an’ posted arl-on-account-o’ pore
Jarge Potter? What—no, sirs? Then bide a minute
an’ I’ll show ye one o’ they bills.” Saying which, Mr.
Bunkle put aside snowy apron and from vasty pocket<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
drew forth such incongruous articles as: a whip lash,
a fragment of tobacco, a nutmeg, a small pistol, and
finally, after laborious groping, a folded paper which,
having carefully smoothed out, he held up against the
wall and they read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">One Hundred Pounds Reward.</span></p>

<p class="center">Dead or Alive.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Whereas</span> George Potter a <span class="smcap">Notorious
Smuggler</span> did upon the 10th inst. of June
fire upon certain of His Majesty’s soldiers
and coastguard officers in the execution of
their duty, thereby <span class="smcap">Maliciously Wounding</span>
divers of them: the above sum, to wit <span class="smcap">One
Hundred Pounds</span>, will be paid to any or such
persons as shall give information leading to
capture of the aforesaid</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Notorious Malefactor.</span><br />
Dead or Alive.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Long Live the King.</span></p>

</div>

<p>“Save’s a’!” exclaimed Sir Hector, “the man Sayle
is unco’ serious an’ damnably determined.... A hundred
pounds! Losh, man, ’twill be an awfu’ temptation
tae the avereecious. How think ye, Peter?”</p>

<p>“Why, I think, sir, as that theer hundred pound
will go a-beggin’——”</p>

<p>“But ... a hundred pounds, man——!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” nodded Mr. Bunkle as he refolded the bill, “’tis
a sight o’ money, I rackon; Jarge ought to be a proud
man this day! ’Twill be the gumboo as usual, sirs?”</p>

<p>Now when their glasses were empty and Sir Hector
had fared unwillingly homewards, Sir John, being
alone, took out the battered snuff-box to view it once
again in keen-eyed scrutiny, more especially the lid;
for there, scratched faintly on the horn, were these two
initials:</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">CONCERNS ITSELF WITH ONE OF THE MANY MYSTERIES OF THE ‘MARKET CROSS INN’</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In these sleepy summer days, while Alfriston
drowsed about its business, High Dering opened
doors and lattices far wider than usual to behold a
troop of workmen who, with planks, poles, ladders and
other paraphernalia, descended upon Dame Haryott’s
little cottage.</p>

<p>These workmen, though Londoners and therefore
“foreigners” in Sussex, to be watched suspiciously
and askance, were nevertheless cheery souls who
whistled and sang and cracked jokes with old Penelope
what time they thatched and glazed and painted.
In the midst of which business down came Mr. Sturton
bristling with outraged authority, who loudly demanded
to know by what right and by whose permission
they dared thus violate the dignity of rotting
thatch and sanctity of decaying wall; whereupon he
was shown a paper signed by a certain name that
caused him to open his eyes very wide and close his
mouth very tight and walk away vastly thoughtful.</p>

<p>My Lord Sayle also, though never stirring abroad,
was by no means inactive, nay, rather his zeal for the
suppression of smugglers in general and capture of
one in particular, waxed to a fervour which was
presently manifest to all and sundry, more especially
the highly virtuous inhabitants of Alfriston, the quiet
of whose sleepy High Street was frequently scandalised
by the tramp of soldiery, hoarse commands and the
clatter of accoutrements; at which times, and with
passionless regularity, Mr. George Potter’s cottage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
would be searched from cellar to attic and its walls
and floors sounded without avail. Thereafter Mr.
Bunkle, awaiting patiently expectant, would conduct
the unsuccessful search-party over the ‘Market Cross
Inn’; would himself show them all manner of possible
hiding-places as: dark corners, deep cupboards,
hidden recesses all more or less dusty and cobwebby;
he was, indeed, never too busy to assist officer, sergeant
or private in their floor and wall-tapping operations,
and would suggest for their further consideration
an infinity of likely and unlikely places as his barns,
stables, lofts and outhouses, his corn-bins, even his
hen-roost and dog-kennel; until officer, sergeant and
private, very dusty, very hot and ever and always
thirstily unsuccessful, would end their labours in parlour
and tap-room and, having nobly refreshed themselves,
would fall in and march away, conscious of having
performed their duty like men.</p>

<p>At which times the weatherbeaten old Cross, wise
with years, might have winked knowing eye had it
possessed one, as did Mr. Bunkle upon a certain
evening in the chaste seclusion of the five-doored
room.</p>

<p>“Are they gone, Peter man?” inquired Sir
Hector.</p>

<p>“Certain sure, indeed, sir, an’ arl on ’em quite as
’appy as usual.”</p>

<p>“This being their second visit within the week?”
inquired Sir John, busied with pencil and memorandum.</p>

<p>“It be, sir!” nodded Mr. Bunkle, slicing a lemon.
“They sojers be ’ard-workin’ lads, sure-lye! This
be the fourth time they’ve turned that ’ay for me as
I’ve got a-laying in the old barn—which be good for
the ’ay an’ doan’t do them no ’arm. An’ seekin’ an’
searchin’ for some one as be never found seems a
tur’ble thirsty business—which be likewise good for
me!”</p>

<p>Here ensued a silence wherein Sir John made notes
in his memorandum and Mr. Bunkle proceeded to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
concoct that mystery known as “gumboo,” while
Sir Hector, puffing his pipe, watched with appreciative
expectation.</p>

<p>From adjacent tap-room issued the drowsy murmur
of neighbourly talk, the clank of pewter, an occasional
laugh; but all at once this pleasant clamour was
hushed, and Mr. Bunkle, in the act of filling the glasses,
paused and stood glancing obliquely towards the open
lattice, for upon this unnatural stillness grew an
ominous sound, faint at first but swelling ever louder,
wilder, more threatening.</p>

<p>Sir Hector rose, Sir John closed his memorandum,
Mr. Bunkle leant from the window, for now above this
ominous sound rose another, the clatter of running
feet in desperate flight from the oncoming terror of
the “hue and cry.”</p>

<p>And then the small chamber seemed full of men who
muttered uneasily to each other.</p>

<p>“The sojers, Peter!” quoth Mr. Muddle. “’Tis
the sojers a-comin’ back again!”</p>

<p>“’Tis Jarge!” added Mr. Pursglove dolefully.
“’Tis pore Jarge Potter ... runnin’ fur ’is loife....
An’ us caan’t do nowt fur ’ee——” Even as he spoke
was the sound of a distant shot.</p>

<p>“Not ’ere, ye caan’t!” answered Mr. Bunkle,
shaking his head. “So off wi’ ye, lads!”</p>

<p>Hereupon the five doors opened, closed, and the three
were alone again.</p>

<p>“Peter Bunkle,” cried Sir Hector, “Peter—man,
though a’ the warld kens I’m no smuggler the noo,
yet if Geordie Potter’s taken they shall tak’ me
too!”</p>

<p>“Nay, Sir Hector, what’ll be the good o’ that?”
demurred Mr. Bunkle, following him out into the
tap-room.</p>

<p>“Whisht, man—hark’ee!”</p>

<p>The running feet were much closer now; on they
came in wild career, though every now and then they
seemed to falter oddly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>“B’ the Powers—’e’ll never do it!” cried Mr.
Bunkle. “’Ark ’ow ’e runs—he’m wounded!”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” exclaimed Sir Hector, and swung
open the door, and leapt aside as a man blundered
past him, a woeful figure, torn, mired and bloody, who
gasped painfully and reeled in his stride.</p>

<p>Forthwith Sir Hector clapped to the door, and would
have barred it, but Mr. Bunkle stayed him.</p>

<p>“No, no, sir!” he cried. “It looks more innocenter
open an’, besides, Jarge only wants a minute ...
watch ’im!”</p>

<p>Upon the wide hearth a fire smouldered, and into
and over this fire Mr. Potter staggered; they heard
the rattle of a chain within the chimney, a breathless,
“Arl roight, Peter!” and Mr. Potter vanished amid
sparks and smoke.</p>

<p>A moment later the first of his pursuers, lifting
musket-butt to batter the stout door, found it ajar
and entered, panting, to behold two gentlemen seated
in amicable converse upon the wide settle, and Mr.
Bunkle deferentially awaiting their orders; whereupon
the panting soldier gasped and, gaping, was thrust
aside by a panting officer, a ferocious gentleman,
plump, peevish and blown, who, perceiving this picture
of placid ease, immediately gaped also.</p>

<p>“Why ... why, what the devil!” he gasped,
staring about the orderly tap-room in round-eyed
amazement, while his breathless subordinates peered
over his shoulders; and, finding no better expression
to fit the occasion, he repeated it, louder than before,
“What the devil!”</p>

<p>“Extraordinary!” exclaimed Sir John, viewing the
breathless gentleman in mild wonder. “Mr. Bunkle,
you may bring us some o’ your famous gumboo.”</p>

<p>“Well ... damme!” panted the officer.</p>

<p>“Aye, but why, sir?” inquired Sir John, whereat
the officer grew a trifle redder in the face and, scowling
upon Sir John, fell back upon his original remark:</p>

<p>“What the devil!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>“My dear sir,” quoth Sir John, “not being an army
man myself, I am consequently a little at a loss, and
should be glad to know precisely what evolution,
manœuvre or exercise you and your comrades are
engaged upon?”</p>

<p>The officer blinked, stared about him dazedly, and
scowled upon Sir John blacker than ever.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, having somewhat recovered his
breath, “I am Panter o’ the Third! Captain Panter,
sir, and am here in pursuit o’ the notorious smuggler,
George Potter, who entered this doorway not two
minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“Amazing!” murmured Sir John, shaking his head.
“Hector, you hear what Captain Panter says?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I hear,” answered Sir Hector, staring at the
Captain and shaking his head also. “’Tis fair
astonishin’, John!”</p>

<p>“Why, what d’ye mean, sir?” demanded the
Captain angrily. “What the devil d’ye mean? I’ve
got eyes, and I saw our man run through this doorway,
damme!”</p>

<p>“Mebbe ’tis the sun, Johnnie?” Sir Hector suggested.
“An’ sunstroke’s an awfu’ thing, y’ ken, ’tis bad as
strong drink tae mak’ a man see visions——”</p>

<p>“Visions, sir!” cried Captain Panter, “to the
devil with your visions, sir! You, Ensign Page, did
we see our man run in here or no?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly we did, sir!”</p>

<p>“And you, Sergeant, did we or did we not?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” answered the Sergeant, saluting, “we
did; leastways you did, but I didn’t—that is, not
pre-zackly as I could swear to ... me not being
capable o’ seein’ nothin’ but the stock o’ Private
Adamses musket as, owin’ to Private Adamses windictiveness,
’ad caught me in the ab-domen, sir,
doublin’ of me up like a jack-knife and renderin’
me——”</p>

<p>“Damme!” roared the Captain, stamping with
fury, “will ye hold your infernal tongue! Page, take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
ten men and search this cursed inn all over again
... the fireplace yonder first!”</p>

<p>The embers were scattered immediately and two
zealous soldiers, ducking under the arch of the mantel,
stood in the wide chimney to peer, to prod with
bayonets, to pound with musket-butts until they
sneezed, choked and reappeared coughing and black
with fallen soot, to the suppressed delight of their
comrades and the furious chagrin of their Captain, who
promptly cursed them forth to their instant ablutions.</p>

<p>“Sergeant,” he cried, “surround this damned
tavern and let nobody out or in, d’ye hear?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I do, sir,” answered the Sergeant, saluting;
“any person so attempting to be——”</p>

<p>“Be off!” roared the Captain.</p>

<p>“Aye, sir. And if fugitive discovers hisself, we to
shoot at same with intent to——”</p>

<p>“Aye—shoot and be damned!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” answered the Sergeant, and with
another salute he wheeled smartly, strode into the
street, bellowed incoherencies at his perspiring men
and marched them away to their stations.</p>

<p>“You, landlord,” quoth Captain Panter, seating
himself and stretching dusty legs, “bring me a bottle
o’ burgundy—now, at once! And as for the rest o’
ye, I’ll let you know I’m Panter o’ the Third and not
to be gammoned by a tale o’ cock and bull!”</p>

<p>The wine being brought, Captain Panter filled and
drank thirstily while the place rang and reverberated
with the tread of heavy feet and thuds of musket-butts
that marked the searchers’ activity.</p>

<p>“O John,” said Sir Hector, after some while, “wull
ye harken tae yon noble heroes! Is it no a graund
thing tae be a sojer?”</p>

<p>At this, the Captain set down his glass with a bang.
Quoth he:</p>

<p>“I’ll thank ye to leave my profession alone!”</p>

<p>“I will that!” answered Sir Hector. “I’ve no’
juist hankered tae be a catchpoll, y’ ken.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>“Catch——” the Captain choked.</p>

<p>“Poll!” added Sir Hector. “Catchpoll, laddie——”</p>

<p>“By all the devils!” exclaimed the Captain, rising,
but at this moment Ensign Page re-entered, dusty and
dishevelled.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, casting looks of yearning upon the
Captain’s bottle, “I beg to report that we have searched
everywhere to no effect.”</p>

<p>“But, burn me,” exclaimed the Captain, “the
rascal must be here! You saw him enter that door,
we all saw him, and he’s had no time to win clear ...
besides, the place is surrounded.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, sir,” answered Ensign Page, still
eyeing the bottle thirstily, “there’s never a sign of
him high nor low.”</p>

<p>“And I say he’s here somewhere, hid. Where ha’
you looked?”</p>

<p>“In all the usual places, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then go search the unusual places!”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“I say,” fumed the Captain, “that the rogue must
be here somewhere, and if he’s here, here he shall be
found.... Go, find him, sir!”</p>

<p>The young Ensign saluted the bottle and departed.
So was a new series of thumps and bangs and tramplings
alow and aloft, what time the autocratic Captain
Panter sipped his wine and glared at the occupants
of the settle who seemed so very much at their ease;
and, as the wine grew low, his choler rose correspondingly.
He viewed Sir Hector’s shabby garments, Sir
John’s plain attire, and setting them down as persons
of no condition, treated them as such.</p>

<p>“Sunstroke!” he snarled. “Sunstroke, begad!
’Tis very evident ye’re aiding and abetting this rascally
smuggler—both o’ ye! Could I but be assured o’ this,
I’d march ye to prison, aye, I would, by Jove! B’gad,
but you may be arrant smugglers yourselves—you’ve
the cursed, sly look of ’t.”</p>

<p>“Laddie,” answered Sir Hector mildly, “what wi’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
sunstroke an’ the bottle, ye’re no juist reesponsible
for the clatter o’ your feckless tongue——”</p>

<p>“Tongue, sir, tongue? D’ye dare suggest I’m not
perfectly sober?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I dare that!” nodded Sir Hector; “I dare
suggest that what wi’ sun an’ the bottle ye’ll be seein’
smugglers crawlin’ up y’r arrms an’ legs gin ye drink
ony mair.... Man, ye’re growin’ purple i’ the face,
y’r eyne be rollin’ in y’r heid, an’ ye look sae uncanny
an’ talk sae——”</p>

<p>“Talk, is it—talk!” roared the Captain, shaking
his fist. “At the least I talk English and you, like
the bog-trotting Irishman y’are, and be——”</p>

<p>Uttering an inarticulate roar, Sir Hector leapt from
his chair, bounded across the room, and Captain Panter
of the Third found himself whirled aloft in mighty
hands that held him pinned fast between two of the
ceiling-beams, breathless, shaken and utterly confounded.</p>

<p>“O man,” quoth Sir Hector in bitter apostrophe,
“can ye no’ ken a Scot when ye see him? Ye muckle
fule, can ye no’ see the differ’ betwixt a Scot an’ the
lave o’ puir humanity? D’ye no’ ken that the Scots
be the salt o’ the airth? An’, O man, I’m a Scot o’
the Scots, being Hector Lauchlan MacLean o’ Duart.
Ma puir wee mannie, I’ve ate things the like o’ yesel’
in a sallet afore to-day an’ ne’er kenned it!”</p>

<p>Having thus delivered himself, Sir Hector set the
dazed and breathless Captain gently upon his feet,
a very astonished officer, who gulped, stared and was
fumbling in a numb sort of fashion for the hilt of his
sword, when the young Ensign reappeared once more,
more dusty and heated than ever.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, “we’ve seen neither hide nor hair
of our man though we’ve turned the place upside
down.”</p>

<p>Captain Panter stared vaguely at the speaker, and
from him to a certain spot between the beams above
his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>“Upside ... down!” he murmured. “Oh! Ah!
Fall in your men!” Having said which, the Captain
walked slowly out of the inn, looking neither right nor
left.</p>

<p>And presently the Sergeant’s voice was heard
uplifted in divers inarticulate roarings; followed a
ring and clatter of muskets and, with martial swing
and measured tramp, Captain Panter and his dusty
company marched away through the mellowing afternoon
sunshine.</p>

<p>And, after some while, appeared Mr. Muddle’s head
at the open lattice.</p>

<p>“Arl clear, Peter!” he announced, whereupon Mr.
Bunkle nodded and emitted a cheery whistle, which
was immediately answered by those ghostly rappings,
such as Sir John remembered to have heard once
before.</p>

<p>“Aweel, that’s over, God be thankit!” quoth Sir
Hector fervently.</p>

<p>“Aye, sir!” nodded Mr. Bunkle. “’Twere a bit
orkard-like for Jarge, but then every summer ’as its
rainy day!”</p>

<p>The rattle of a chain, a scuffling sound in the chimney,
and Mr. Potter stepped forth in more woeful plight
than ever by reason of soot.</p>

<p>“Havers, Geordie man, an’ how are ye the noo?”
inquired Sir Hector. “Are ye wounded?”</p>

<p>“A bit, sir—’ere an’ theer,” admitted Mr. Potter,
“by reason of a quick-set as happed in my road.
But gimme a glass o’ grog, chilled, Peter, an’ soap an’
water, an’ I’ll be never naun the worse, I rackon.”
And, making a leg, he limped away on Mr. Bunkle’s
ready arm.</p>

<p>“A memorable afternoon, Hector!” quoth Sir
John. “In Sussex one truly lives these days! Paris?
London? What be these to Alfriston? And now,
come your ways.”</p>

<p>“Whaur awa’, John?”</p>

<p>“To visit Rose’s aunt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>“Na, na, John. D’ye no’ ken she’s a widow?
Forbye, she’s a wee person, an’ none sae ill-lookin’——”</p>

<p>“You have seen her, then?”</p>

<p>“Glimpsed her, lad, from ayont the party wall.
She’s my neighbour, y’ ken.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, come and meet her.”</p>

<p>“An’ her a widow-body, an’ me new shaved!”</p>

<p>“Shaved, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Aye! When fresh shaved I’m no’ sae ill-lookin’
mysel’, d’ye see, John. An’ I was ever a cautious
body, as ye ken weel. So I’ll juist bide here an’ smoke
a pipe wi’ Geordie Potter.... But, John”—and
here Sir Hector’s English became precise—“there is
a matter hath troubled me this week and more. John,
she is a sweet, good maid, though mayhap a little
overbearing now and then, and much above her
condition.”</p>

<p>“Meaning Rose?”</p>

<p>“Herself, John ... you—you see her very often
of late.... And, minding her station in life and
yours, I would ask ye, John, as one who loves you
and respects yon maid, are you ... making love
to her?”</p>

<p>“As often as possible, Hector!”</p>

<p>“As John Derwent?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Hector.”</p>

<p>“O John ... O Johnnie lad! Can ye no leave
purity and innocence alone?”</p>

<p>“Not when I want ’em in a wife.”</p>

<p>“Wife,” ejaculated Sir Hector, falling back a
step in sheer amazement—“wife, is it? You—you
with a wife, John?”</p>

<p>“In time, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Losh, Johnnie man! And here was I thinking——”</p>

<p>“Evil of me, Hector. My reputation dogs me even
yet!”</p>

<p>“Forgi’e me, lad, forgi’e me! And ... O John,
you would actually marry a—a serving-wench—you?”</p>

<p>“I!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>“And by heaven, I honour ye for’t! Doth she love
ye?”</p>

<p>“Well, Hector, there are times when I am gravely
doubtful ... yesterday, for instance, she called me
‘John’ for the first time!”</p>

<p>“An’ blushed when she said it, lad?”</p>

<p>“Like a rose, Hector!”</p>

<p>“’Twas a good sign, sure?”</p>

<p>“Aye—in any maid but Rose. Thus when Rose,
blushing rosily as Rose should, calleth me ‘John,’ my
assurance shakes and I grow doubtful.”</p>

<p>“But can ye no’ find out, John?”</p>

<p>“Aye—her aunt might tell me!” So saying, he
turned and went his thoughtful way, leaving Sir
Hector staring after him in deepest perplexity.</p>

<p>Her Grace the Duchess of Connington was seated in
her little garden busily shelling peas.</p>

<p>“Ah, and is it you—at last, sir?” quoth she,
acknowledging Sir John’s profound obeisance with a
smiling nod. “Pray, why ha’ you been so long a-calling?”</p>

<p>“I awaited vainly your niece’s invitation, madam,
and am here to-day unbidden.”</p>

<p>“Then you may sit here beside me, sir.... I ha’
been hither dragged into these solitudes by my headstrong
Herminia and, on the whole, should like it
vastly well were it not for the giant.”</p>

<p>“Giant, madam?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Blunderbore himself, sir! A fierce, fearsome,
great creature in shabbiest clothes and matted wig!
An odious, huge person who persistently peers and
prys upon me—over the wall yonder. So slinking
and sly! A contemptible creeper! And puffs
tobacco from a pipe!”</p>

<p>“Nay, madam, can you possibly mean my very dear
friend, Sir Hector MacLean, a most honourable, worthy
gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Then why should the person persistently pry and
peer on our privacy, pray?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>“’Tis, I am sure, with no will to offend. Believe
me, he is of nature the most gentle——”</p>

<p>“With the looks of an ogre, sir!”</p>

<p>“But, indeed, Duchess——”</p>

<p>“Hush, Sir John! In Alfriston pray remember I
am Mrs. Saunders!”</p>

<p>“And I, madam, am John Derwent.”</p>

<p>“And pray, John Derwent, what is the part you
play here ’mid the rustic wild?”</p>

<p>“Madam, I am principal lover to Mrs. Saunders’
niece Rose.”</p>

<p>“A difficult rôle, sir!” answered the little Duchess,
with her youthful laugh.</p>

<p>“Indeed, ’twould seem so,” he answered a little
ruefully. “And ’tis thus I am here, humbly seeking
your advice, dear Mrs. Saunders.”</p>

<p>“Nay, fie, sir! Is not Sir John Dering accounted
wholly irresistible, a wild and winning wooer, terribly
tempestuous?”</p>

<p>“Only by idle gossip, madam. And John Derwent
is the reverse of all this—a very patient lover he, full
o’ reverent humility.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the Duchess, and shelled three
peas with rapid dexterity, which done, she glanced at
Sir John with her shrewd, pretty eyes, and shook her
small head decidedly. “Alas, my poor John, your
reverent humility shall never win Herminia!”</p>

<p>Now, at this moment, Chance, Instinct or some
even finer sense, caused Sir John to glance up at the
adjacent wall in time to see the gleam of a white hand
among the ivy that surmounted the coping; thus,
when he answered, his voice was a thought louder than
before:</p>

<p>“But, dear Mrs. Saunders, ’tis Rose and Rose only
that I do so love for——”</p>

<p>“Stay, sir! Pray remember that Rose being Rose
is yet always and ever Herminia!”</p>

<p>“And yet, madam, how utterly dissimilar, how
vastly different! Betwixt the sweet simplicity of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
gentle Rose and the cold worldliness of the arrogant
Herminia, a great gulf is fixed that none may bridge
saving only—Herminia. And so it is I fear.”</p>

<p>“For yourself?”</p>

<p>“For us both. I fear lest Herminia’s selfish pride
bring lasting misery to poor Rose and John.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the little Duchess again, and
sat turning a pea-pod idly in her small fingers. “And
yet, Herminia hath a noble heart, a warmly generous
nature ... though the sweet soul can be a fierce,
passionate wretch.... But, alack, John, she never
knew a mother’s fostering care ... she was spoiled,
petted and pampered and became the idol of her wild
and reckless father.... Aye me!... John Derwent,
look at me and show me John Dering’s heart. Do you
indeed so love—Rose?”</p>

<p>“Beyond all expression!” he answered, looking
into the eyes that questioned his so keenly.</p>

<p>“Why, then, John,” said she at last, “were I in
thy place, I should forget John Derwent’s so great
humility awhile—just ... for a moment!”</p>

<p>“A moment?”</p>

<p>“Well, say two moments, John ... or even
three!... O Sir John Dering, art grown so strangely
dense?”</p>

<p>Then Sir John rose.</p>

<p>“A moment,” he repeated, “two moments, or
even three!” Taking her Grace’s two small hands, he
kissed them rapturously. “Thou dear, kind friend,”
quoth he, “thy trust, thy faith in ‘the poor dog with
a bad name’ shall, methinks, resolve all my difficulties....
It shall be three! At the stile beyond
the little footbridge.”</p>

</div>

<p>Sunset had long since paled its splendour;
evening was fading into night, a warm and
languorous twilight where stars peeped and a waxing
radiance gave promise of a moon, while from wood
remote, vague, mysterious stole the bubbling murmur
of a night-jar.</p>

<p>And my Lady Herminia, having crossed the little
footbridge that spanned whispering stream, paused to
lean upon the adjacent stile, viewing all things tender-eyed,
from the homely lights of Alfriston, twinkling
here and there beyond dim-seen trees, to the far-flung
majesty of the swelling, silent Downs beyond. Yet,
it is to be supposed, she was by no means unconscious
of him who stood beside her, though she started when
at last he spoke.</p>

<p>“This,” said Sir John, “is the stile beyond the
little footbridge.”</p>

<p>“Well?” she inquired, a little breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Won’t you say ‘John’?”</p>

<p>“Well, John?” she repeated obediently.</p>

<p>“And it is an aged stile, Rose. See how warped
are its timbers. And consequently ’tis very like
that many a man hath kissed his maid here.... Say
‘Yes, John.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, John.”</p>

<p>“And yet, Rose, as I do think, none of them all ever
kissed with such reverent fervour as we are about
to do.... Say ‘Never in all the world, John!’”</p>

<p>“Nay ... oh, wait!” she cried more breathlessly
than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed, I am in no haste,” he answered. “But
here to-night, Rose, thou and I that so love each other,
do plight our troth....”</p>

<p>“Art sure I love thee, then?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“’Tis so I have dared dream, child.”</p>

<p>“And how if I—do not?”</p>

<p>“Then is the sun out and I lost i’ the dark.”</p>

<p>“Art so—very assured?” she questioned again;
and then his arms were about her and he drew her
close, lifting her unwilling head that he might look
into her eyes.</p>

<p>“O loved maid!” he murmured. “Sweet Flower o’
Life, thou and I are alone here with the God that made
us and yon everlasting hills.... Could thine eyes
speak me aught but truth? Are these the eyes of
Rose or the Lady Herminia?”</p>

<p>“Of ... Rose!” she whispered. And so he kissed
her, her eyes, her hair, her lips, until at last: “O
John,” she murmured, “art thou John Derwent or ...
the ‘Wicked Dering’? For indeed ... Aunt
Lucinda said but three, sir!”</p>

<span class="smaller">WHICH CONTAINS FURTHER MENTION OF A CERTAIN SNUFF-BOX</span></h2>

</div>

<p>“To-day, Bob, is Thursday, I think?”</p>

<p>“It is, sir.”</p>

<p>“And your researches teach us that, upon every
Thursday, Sturton rides over to Seaford, generally
in the evening?”</p>

<p>“Aye, your honour, to a small tavern called ‘The
Anchor.’”</p>

<p>“And there meets a red-headed, seafaring man to
whom he pays money.”</p>

<p>“Pre-cisely, sir.”</p>

<p>“The sailor-man’s name being Skag—Jonas Skag.”</p>

<p>“The same, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, Bob, see the horses saddled; we will go
a-riding.”</p>

<p>“To Seaford, sir?”</p>

<p>“To Seaford, Bob.”</p>

<p>Thus they were presently ambling down Alfriston’s
ancient street, between neat and homely cottages from
whose doors heads nodded in cheery greeting, past
flowery gardens, by fragrant rickyard, where they had
brief vision of Mr. Muddle virtuously busied with a
pitchfork despite his limp, and so to the winding,
tree-shaded road that led uphill and down towards the
purple slopes of Windover.</p>

<p>“Sturton hath kept ye fairly busy o’ late, Bob.”</p>

<p>“His movements, sir, has been constant.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Bob, since we gave up the harassing
tactics for a more subtle method, your days ha’ been
fully occupied. Yet I trust you ha’ found time to keep
a friendly eye upon our Ancient Dumbrell?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>“I have, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good! And how is——”</p>

<p>“She is very well, your honour, and ... as young
as ever!”</p>

<p>“Hum!” quoth Sir John, and they rode awhile in
silence. Corporal Robert made to drop behind, but
his master stayed him with a gesture.</p>

<p>“Regarding Mrs. Rose, Bob, she often visits the
Dumbrells, I think?”</p>

<p>“When not wi’ Dame Haryott, sir, or slave-driving
Willum Thompson.... A on-common dirty soldier
he’d ha’ made, sir!”</p>

<p>“You see her—Mrs. Rose—frequently, then?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p>“And do you still think her ... ‘leggy’ was the
term, I fancy?”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir, but I beg to withdraw ‘leggy’ as not
being in order, Mrs. Rose not being ex-actly what she
seems.”</p>

<p>“Explain, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, her speech don’t always match her
country clothes, and sometimes she’s that haughty!”</p>

<p>“Aye, I’ve noticed the same, myself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean by ‘yes,’ Bob?”</p>

<p>“I mean, sir, as ’tis nowise sup-rising you should
notice, seeing as I’ve noticed as your honour notices—I
mean that she notices—that she an’ your honour
seem to take a powerful sight o’ notice of each other,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Aye, we do, Bob.”</p>

<p>“No offence, your honour?”</p>

<p>“None in the world, Bob.”</p>

<p>“But, y’ see, sir, there’s others has noticed and a-noticing
same—daily, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Who, Robert?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s Peter Bunkle for one, there’s nothing
as he don’t notice! And old Mr. Dumbrell, he talks
o’ nothing else, lately.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, he tells you that I am ‘sweet on her,’ I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Con-stantly, sir!”</p>

<p>“Well, Bob, the Aged Soul is right—so I am!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“Ha, you were already aware o’ this incredible
fact?”</p>

<p>“I sur-mised same, sir.”</p>

<p>“You see, Bob, I intend to marry her.”</p>

<p>The Corporal was, and actually looked, startled.</p>

<p>“Marry her!” he repeated in a strangled voice.
“Your honour!... Marry her!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Bob, I intend to marry and settle down at
High Dering at last, unless—aye, unless the Fateful
Sisters see fit to cut short the thread o’ my existence.”</p>

<p>“God forbid, sir!”</p>

<p>“Amen, Bob. And yet the world would wag as
merrily without me.... Do you believe in presentiments,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“No, sir ... and yet——”</p>

<p>“Neither do I.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I’ve known men as did.”</p>

<p>“Aye, we mortals be queer creatures, Bob! An ill
dream, a fit o’ the indigestion, a chill on the liver, and we
grow full o’ forebodings, see dire omens and portents in
everything and start at our own shadows.... Queer
creatures!... And here we part awhile. You to
keep an eye on the unsuspecting Sturton should he ride
hither, and I to ‘The Anchor,’ where you will meet me
at six.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir!”</p>

<p>“’Tis like enough our quest may be ended sooner
than we hoped, Robert.”</p>

<p>So saying, Sir John gave his steed the rein and rode
on into Seaford town. Dismounting before the small
Anchor Inn, he gave his horse to the ostler and his
hand to Mr. Levitt the landlord, who forthwith ushered
him into cosy parlour.</p>

<p>Mr. Levitt was by nature a jovial soul but, just now,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
his good-natured features were overcast, and he sighed,
shaking despondent head over that hard Fate which,
as he mournfully declared, “’ad made o’ pore Potter
an ’omeless wanderer an’ drove Cap’n Sharkie Nye
into the arms o’ them French furrineers and ruinated
my trade, sir. Aye, by the Pize, sir, I moight jest as
well close the ol’ ‘Anchor’ for arl the good I do these
days—crool ’ard, I calls it!”</p>

<p>“How, is trade so bad, Mr. Levitt?”</p>

<p>“Worser’n bad it be, sir!”</p>

<p>“Is the place quite empty, then?”</p>

<p>“As a blessed drum, sir! Never a soul ’cept a
couple o’ naun-account chaps. Lord, I dunno wot
Sussex be a-comin’ tu, that I doan’t. Wot I sez is as
them theer Preventives will ruin old England, aye by
Goles, they will—dannel ’em! Shall us mak’ it
French wine, sir, or summat a liddle stronger?”</p>

<p>“Nay, let it be October ale, thank ye, Mr. Levitt.
And I’ll take it in the ‘tap.’”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” demurred the landlord, “the ‘tap’
bean’t ’ardly the place for a gen’elman o’ your quality,
an’ Sir ’Ector’s friend an’ arl.”</p>

<p>“But I’m minded for a bench and sanded floor,”
smiled Sir John, and into the tap he took his way
accordingly. It was a smallish chamber very orderly
and clean, but empty except for a carter, in smock and
leggings, who snored lustily with his head on the table,
and a raw-boned individual with a shock of red hair
and a dull, fish-like eye, who sat huddled in a corner
and gloomed. To whom Sir John forthwith addressed
himself:</p>

<p>“Friend, you drink nothing?”</p>

<p>“Well, an’ ’ow can I drink,” answered the red-headed
man in surly tone; “’ow’s any man to drink
out of a empty tankard?”</p>

<p>“That is easily amended.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it, an arl—when a honest man’s pockets be
as empty as ’is tankard an’ nobody to ax ’im to take
nothin’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>“Then I will. Fill for him, Mr. Levitt.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, sir!” answered the landlord; “’e’s
’ad enough, I rackon!”</p>

<p>“’Oo’s ’ad enough?” demanded the red-haired
man truculently. “I ain’t never ’ad enough! I
never do ’ave enough, no, nor ain’t likely to ’ave
enough! An’ if the loikes o’ ’im loikes to treat the
loikes o’ me, what’s to prevent?”</p>

<p>“Well, keep a civil tongue to the gen’elman,
an’ dannel ye, Jonas Skag!” and Mr. Levitt, setting
down the refilled tankard with a bang, stalked
away.</p>

<p>“Jonas Skag!” repeated Sir John, eyeing his unlovely
companion and shifting nearer to him; “I’ve
heard that name before.”</p>

<p>“No, you ain’t!” retorted the other fiercely.
“Leastways if y’ave you’ve never ’eard naun but
good of it!”</p>

<p>“True,” nodded Sir John; “for you told it me
yourself.”</p>

<p>“What—I did?” exclaimed the red-headed man
leaning forward to scowl.</p>

<p>“Aye,” answered Sir John, leaning forward also
until he might look into the close-set eyes opposite.
“You informed me that a more honest man never
trod a plank.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis true! Honest I be, aye, honest as the
day—an’ I’d loike t’ see the man as says I bean’t!”
So saying, he lifted the ale to unshaven mouth and
drank greedily.</p>

<p>“You don’t smoke tobacco!” said Sir John.</p>

<p>“No, I doan’t! An’ wot be that t’ you? Why
should I smoke? I doan’t loike smoke an’ I bean’t
a-goin’ to smoke! Not for the loikes o’ you, no—nor
no man breathin’, I ain’t!”</p>

<p>“Perchance you prefer snuff?” Sir John suggested,
finger and thumb in waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>“An’ wot if I do? I ain’t beggin’ an’ pleadin’—no,
nor yet axin’ you for any, be I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>“No,” answered Sir John; “but you may have a
pinch for good-fellowship’s sake, none the less, if
you’re so minded.”</p>

<p>“Well, s’posin’ I be so minded?”</p>

<p>“Then I make you welcome to my box.” And Sir
John took snuff-box from pocket and gave it to the
red-haired man’s hairy fingers.</p>

<p>The box was shut, and in the act of opening it Jonas
Skag grew suddenly still, glaring down at the thing
he held, speechless, motionless, scarce breathing, as if
indeed it had possessed some deadly power to blast
him as he sat; then he seemed to shrink in his clothes,
his writhing lips opened, closed again speechlessly,
and slipping from his twitching fingers the battered
horn snuff-box rolled upon the tiled floor; even then
he stared down at it where it lay, until moving slowly
like an old man, he leaned down, shaking hand outstretched.
But with an airy motion of his riding-whip,
Sir John flicked it from his reach and picking it up
slipped it back into his pocket.</p>

<p>With the same unnatural slowness Jonas Skag rose
to his feet, and leaning across the table stood glaring
at that pocket of Sir John’s waistcoat which held that
dreadful thing; and after some interval, he spoke in
broken whisper:</p>

<p>“Gimme ... gimme——”</p>

<p>Sir John, leaning back against the wall, stared up
into the twitching face, while slowly, slowly, the wide,
bloodshot eyes crept up and up until they were glaring
into his; thus for a long moment eyes met eyes, and
it seemed that Jonas Skag was halting between two
courses, groping meanwhile in his darkened soul and
questioning passionately with his look. At last,
uttering a hoarse, inarticulate sound, he turned,
lurched to the door, opened it, leaned there a moment,
and was gone.</p>

<p>Then Sir John arose and, leaving his ale untasted,
went seeking the landlord.</p>

<p>“Mr. Levitt,” said he, “I remember meeting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
yonder red-haired fellow aboard the <i>True Believer</i>.
Is he one of Captain Sharkie’s regular men?”</p>

<p>“Not by no manner o’ means, sir!” answered Mr.
Levitt. “A drunken, quarrelsome, naun-account chap
be Jonas. Las’ toime Sharkie ’apped along—ah,
a-settin’ in that very cheer, ‘Levitt,’ says ’e, ‘I’m
done wi’ that Jonas for good an’ arl!’ ’e says.”</p>

<p>“And you, like Captain Sharkie, do not trust him?”</p>

<p>“Not so fur as I can see ’im, sir.... Why, here
be Corporal Doubleday! How goes it, sir, an’ what’ll
we make it?”</p>

<p>At a nod from Sir John, the Corporal, having “made
it” ale, and finished it with commendable speed, Sir
John presently arose and, taking hearty leave of Mr.
Levitt, stepped into the yard and mounted.</p>

<p>“Well, Bob?” he inquired as they rode. “Our
Sturton made hither as usual?”</p>

<p>“He did, sir, but——”</p>

<p>“Was met by the red-headed man, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Pre-cisely, sir. Which man seemed in mighty
per-tub-ation about somewhat or other, whereupon
Sturton takes him into the Bull yonder. And soon
arter, sir, out they came from the yard and both of
’em mounted, and away at a gallop. Which seems
strange.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” exclaimed Sir John. “Did they ride
towards Alfriston?”</p>

<p>“Aye, your honour.”</p>

<p>“About how long ago?”</p>

<p>“Eggs-ackly eighteen and a half minutes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You did not follow ’em?”</p>

<p>“Your honour’s orders were to call for you at——”</p>

<p>“Aye, very true, Bob!... Eighteen minutes!”</p>

<p>Sir John reined in his horse and sat as if deeply
pondering, while the Corporal watched him, serenely
patient.</p>

<p>“Is aught wrong, sir?” he inquired at last.</p>

<p>Sir John glanced up and round about upon the
peaceful beauty of the countryside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>“’Twill be a lovely evening, Robert.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, sir.”</p>

<p>“We don’t believe in presentiments, do we, Bob?”</p>

<p>“No, sir—leastways——”</p>

<p>“Or omens and the like liverish fancies? Now, do
we happen to believe in warnings, by any chance?”</p>

<p>“Depends, sir, on who warns and what about.”</p>

<p>“And after all, Bob, as Mr. Potter once remarked:
‘What is to be, must be!’ So let us on and be done
with it one way or t’other.”</p>

<p>“Why such speed, sir?” inquired the Corporal
as they galloped up the long hill out of
Seaford.</p>

<p>“Aye, why indeed!” answered Sir John. “Life is
short enough o’ conscience! Let us then rather amble
the whiles I sum up our case as it standeth to-day.
And heed and mark me well, Robert.... And we begin
with my Lord Sayle, a sordid creature of sordid tastes,
of whom ’twere better to talk in metaphor.... My
Lord Sayle, then, is reported to have a keen eye for
beauty and a catholic taste; the stately lily, the humble,
modest violet each alike find favour in his eyes and he
culleth them as he may; he acquireth by money, by
guile, by force—aye, frequently by force, for the which
he useth divers agents ... and James Sturton we
know for one of these agents.</p>

<p>“Upon a certain evening some two years ago, a
young village girl went up Windover, she going thither
to carry a cake to her lover, Roger Hobden, who was
tending sheep there. So much at least we know for
fact; here followeth surmise: James Sturton, in company
with another of my lord’s agents, by name Jonas
Skag, being about their master’s evil business, there
met with her, and in this desolate place she screamed,
and with good reason! Hearing which outcry, Hobden
came running. He fought desperately, one against the
two, or more for aught we know, and in the struggle
received a blow struck, as I believe, by Sturton, though
much harder than he meant.... And so died poor
Roger Hobden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>“But why should you think ’twas Sturton struck the
fatal blow, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why should Sturton be paying ‘hush-money’ to
Jonas Skag?”</p>

<p>“Aye, true, your honour!”</p>

<p>“And have become my lord’s very slave?”</p>

<p>“True again, sir! And he’s ever at Oxham’s beck
and call, moreover.”</p>

<p>“One other surmise, Bob.... During the struggle
Jonas Skag’s pocket was torn, and out o’ that pocket
fell a horn snuff-box——”</p>

<p>“Why, your honour, here’s a powerful lot o’ surmises!
’Tis all mighty reasonable, but ye can’t convict
a man nor yet hang a man by surmise.”</p>

<p>“Very true, Bob. And here is the snuff-box!”</p>

<p>Corporal Robert examined the sorry thing with a
degree of interest.</p>

<p>“But how,” he inquired, handing it back again,
“how can your honour be sure ’twas the same box, or
that Skag ever saw it, or lost it on the fatal oc-casion?”</p>

<p>“Jonas Skag recognised it, Bob, and in his terror
crawled away to Sturton.”</p>

<p>“Lord!” exclaimed the Corporal, “so this was why
they rid off in such a hurry?”</p>

<p>“Partly, Bob, and partly, I think, to afford us proof
that our surmising is very near the truth.”</p>

<p>“As how, your honour?”</p>

<p>“Look before us, yonder!” The Corporal stared
at the dusty road, at the rolling landscape to right and
left, at Sir John, and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Yonder, Bob, the road, you’ll notice, winds up in
a sharp ascent between steep banks crowned with
trees and dense brush.... You observe?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, in something less than ten minutes we shall
reach the strategic point; then, at word from me, you
will spur and take that hill at full gallop——”</p>

<p>“Ah!” quoth the Corporal; “an ambushment,
sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>“Why, ’tis a likely place for such, Bob. Ha’ you
your pistols?”</p>

<p>“Here, sir!”</p>

<p>“Then have ’em ready! And stoop low in the saddle
... though you will not be their chief target, I
fancy——”</p>

<p>“Your honour ... sir ... Sir John, the risk is
too great to warrant——”</p>

<p>“Tush, Bob! They have seen us long since and,
should we turn tail now, would but choose some other
time and place when we were less prepared. Besides,
there is about the uncertainty a thrill that stirs me
not unpleasingly—and to feel is to be alive!”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir!” answered Robert the Imperturbable,
loosing pistols in holsters.</p>

<p>“On the whole, Bob, the country hath an infinity of
charms, more especially this fair country o’ Sussex.
Now! Spur, man, spur!”</p>

<p>A clatter of hoofs spurning the dust, a creaking of
saddle-leather, and the two high-spirited animals
breasted the steep ascent at a gallop, their riders low-crouched,
pistols in hand; they had reached thus the
steepest part of the hill when from the bank above
rang a shot, followed immediately by a second, and
Sir John, rocking in the saddle, dropped his weapon,
steadied himself and grasped at right forearm; the
Corporal meanwhile, having fired in return, swung to
earth and began to scramble up the bank, but, the
slope being very precipitous, it was some minutes ere
he reached, and vanished among, the dense brush.</p>

<p>“Save thyself further trouble!” cried Sir John.
“The rogues will be well away by now, Bob.”</p>

<p>“They are, sir!” answered the Corporal ruefully.
“But they’ve left a hat behind ’em!”</p>

<p>“A hat, Bob? Then bring it—bring it hither,
man!” Back into the road scrambled Robert forthwith,
to behold his master, pale and bloody, whereupon
he dropped the hat and came running.</p>

<p>“Are ye hurt bad, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>“Pish—naught to matter! The hat, Bob, the
hat!” The Corporal brought it, turning it this way
and that for his master’s inspection.</p>

<p>An ordinary, three-cornered hat, devoid of all ornament
or garnishings, but of excellent material and
workmanship: such a hat as could have covered the
head of a prosperous, highly reputable person only.</p>

<p>“By heavens, Bob!” exclaimed Sir John, grim-lipped.
“’Tis a murderer’s hat and might be a
magistrate’s! Note its sober cock, its generous proportions,
its eminent respectability! Have ye ever
seen it, ere now, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I have, sir!” answered the Corporal, scowling
at the thing he held.</p>

<p>“’Tis a hat in a thousand, Bob, and mayhap shall
aid a rogue to the gallows.... And now, prithee,
look to this arm o’ mine.”</p>

<p>Deftly the Corporal unbuttoned and rolled back
sleeve and ruffled wrist-band, discovering an ugly
graze that scored Sir John’s arm from elbow to wrist.</p>

<p>“Painful, sir?”</p>

<p>“The smart is tolerable,” answered Sir John,
wincing a little as the Corporal lapped the wound in
the neckerchief he had whipped off for the purpose—“tolerable,
Bob, and may be a blessing in disguise.”</p>

<p>“How so, your honour?”</p>

<p>“Nay, dispatch, Bob; the sooner we are away from
here the better.... They may try again, so hurry,
man!”</p>

<p>The bandage in place, the Corporal sprang to saddle
and, setting spurs to their willing horses, they had
soon left that place of danger far behind.</p>

<p>“Now, talking o’ pistol-balls and blessings in disguise,
your honour?” questioned the Corporal at last.</p>

<p>“With my arm thus, Bob, I am free to meet my
Lord Sayle whenever I will.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, his wound should be nigh well by now
and your arm will be mighty stiff to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But not too stiff to kill him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>“Kill?” repeated the Corporal, and, glancing at
his master’s pale, set face, said no more.</p>

<p>“When we fought at the ‘White Hart’ I might ha’
reached him time and again, but held my hand because
of the oath I swore five years agone.”</p>

<p>“Aye, your honour, and to be sure an oath is ever
an’ always an oath!” nodded the Corporal.</p>

<p>“Hum!” quoth Sir John, eyeing the Corporal a
little askance. “But to-day, Bob, I know him for a
thing the world were well rid of ... and yet I will
confess to a foolish prejudice, a ridiculous qualm at
the idea of having the fellow’s death on my hands.
And yet this hath nothing whatever to do with my
oath.”</p>

<p>Here Sir John became thoughtful, whereupon the
Corporal reined half a length to the rear, and thus
they journeyed in silence, until they were come in sight
of the cross-roads.</p>

<p>Now, against the finger-post one of my Lord Sayle’s
bills had been set up, and before this they espied a
stalwart man busily reading by the aid of a short,
though formidable bludgeon with which he ticked off
each word, letter by letter; this, though a somewhat
laborious business, seemed to afford the reader no
small pleasure, for more than once he chuckled, and it
was with a smile upon his face that he now turned to
greet them, touching bludgeon to eyebrow in salute.</p>

<p>“What, Mr. Potter!” exclaimed Sir John. “Where
ha’ you been these last few days?”</p>

<p>“Here and theer, Mus’ Derwent—mostly theer.”</p>

<p>“And how are you?”</p>

<p>“Never better, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you chance to have seen a man pass who has
lost his hat?”</p>

<p>“Nary a one, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, perchance you can recognise the hat—show
it him, Bob.”</p>

<p>At this, Corporal Robert struck himself a resounding
blow upon muscular thigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>“Damme, sir!” he exclaimed woefully. “Asking
your pardon ... but I left it a-lying on the bank
yonder!” Sir John merely looked, whereupon the
Corporal shook his head, wheeled his horse and
galloped back along the road.</p>

<p>“‘One ’undred pound reward,’ sir!” quoth Mr.
Potter, with the greatest unction, when the galloping
hoof-strokes had died away. “‘Dead or Alive,’ Mus’
Derwent!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” nodded Sir John, “surely you run great
risk to venture abroad in daylight, and here of all
places.”</p>

<p>“Why, I dunno as one place be much worse than
t’other, sir.... But one ’undred pound! Lord, I
know it by ’eart.... I wish my old feäther might
ha’ seed it! One ’undred pound for pore Pot’s carkiss—dead
or alive. A powerful sight o’ money it be. I
wouldn’t ha’ thought they’d ha’ valleyed pore Potter
so ’igh-like ... theer was a ’ighwayman-chap as shot
the guard o’ the Lewes coach las’ year, they only
offered twenty-five for ’e!... They’ve got these ’ere
bills posted arl over the plaace ’ereabouts. I know
’em arl an’ I reads ’em arl—reg’lar! But theer be
a brace o’ words as I doan’t rightly onderstand,
otherwise it arl seems fair enough an’ a sight
more than Potter expected. First ’ere be this here
word ‘male-factor.’ Well, ’tis sartin sure I bean’t
no female an’ no more I bean’t no ‘factor’ ... then
’ere be t’other ’un, sir ... ‘not-orious.’ ... Well,
nobody never says as I was ‘orious’ as ever I
knowed.”</p>

<p>His mind at rest upon these two intricate points,
Mr. Potter diffidently suggested they should keep
company together a “small ways,” for:</p>

<p>“Lord, sir,” said he, “what wi’ barns an’
ditches it be few friendly faces pore Potter sees o’
late.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, Sir John rode on at a hand-pace, Mr.
Potter walking beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>“Arm ’urted, sir?” he inquired, noting Sir John’s
bandage.</p>

<p>“Nothing very much, though irksome!”</p>

<p>“Fall, sir?”</p>

<p>“Bullet!”</p>

<p>“Accidental, sir?”</p>

<p>Hereupon Sir John briefly recapitulated the affair,
to Mr. Potter’s round-eyed surprise.</p>

<p>“Lord, sir,” quoth he, “I thought nobody never
shot at nothing nor nobody except pore Potter, these
days.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of your friends Oxham or
Sturton lately?”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir, seed ’em this very day, I did, over to
’Friston.”</p>

<p>“’Friston!” exclaimed Sir John. “Why, that is
Lord Sayle’s place, surely.”</p>

<p>“Aye it be, sir. So there Potter went; ye see,
nobody never thought o’ lookin’ for me in Lord Sayle’s
barns. Well, sir, theer I did behold Oxham an’ Sturton
along o’ Lord Sayle. Lord Sayle was a-fencing wi’ a
gentleman in his shirt-sleeves.”</p>

<p>“Ah, fencing was he?”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir, in ’is shirt-sleeves, when along comes
Oxham and says summat an’ p’ints at Sturton, whereupon
my lord says summat to Sturton in a mighty
passion an’ Sturton says summat to Lord Sayle,
mighty ’umble, an’ Lord Sayle fetches Sturton a clout
wi’ his fencin’-iron an’ sends ’im about ’is business....
An’ now I’ll bid ye good-evenin’, sir; yonder lays my
road.... I’ve a brace o’ birds for ol’ Pen....
Happen I’ll be seeing ye at the Cross purty soon....
The <i>True Believer</i>’ll be across one o’ these nights i’
the dark o’ the moon, for business be business, sir.”
So saying, Mr. Potter climbed the adjacent bank,
paused to touch bludgeon to eyebrow, and was gone.</p>

<p>Sir John was in sight of Alfriston Church spire when,
hearing the approach of galloping hoofs, he turned to
behold the Corporal returning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>“Ah!” said he, noting Robert’s gloom, “our
murderer’s hat had vanished, then?”</p>

<p>“Com-pletely, sir!”</p>

<p>“Well, well, never look so glum, man! Our day
hath not been wholly vain.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE TERROR BY NIGHT</span></h2>

</div>

<p>June coming in glory had flamed out in splendour.
August glowed from dewy dawn to dusky eve; upon
the warm and slumbrous air was the fragrance
of ripening fruit and herb; flowers bloomed sedately
in cottage gardens, they rioted in the hedges, fields
and uplands were ablaze with them where butterflies
wheeled and hovered and bees hummed drowsily
about their unceasing labours. The river, winding
sleepily between reedy banks, made little slumbrous
noises, the very brooks, by reason of the pervading
heat and universal somnolence, seemed to hush their
chatter; and neighbours in shirt-sleeves, meeting in
shady places, yawningly informed each other of the
very obvious fact that it was “tur’ble waarmish-loike!”</p>

<p>Even Mr. Dumbrell, that “aged soul,” perched
upon his accustomed stile, admitted that, in his vast
experience, he had “knowed a colder August....
But, Lord, young man, to ’ear folks talk, you’d think
’twas that ’ot! But look at oi, so grig an’ sproy for
arl my aage, look at oi, will ’ee!”</p>

<p>“Thou’rt a truly wonderful man!” answered Sir
John.</p>

<p>“Ay, sartin-sure-indeed, oi be!” answered the
Aged One. “But oi knawed that afore you was
barn!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mr. Dumbrell, you look heartier than
ever——”</p>

<p>“Well, oi bean’t! ’Ow can oi be—wi’ a musket-ball
a-rattlin’ my innards an’ a granddarter a-rattlin’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
my out’ards—wi’ a bresh? Mak’s me wash my face
twoice a day, she du—twoice!”</p>

<p>“Consequently you look extreme cool and clean.”</p>

<p>“Clean!” snarled the Aged Soul. “Doan’t ’ee say
so, young man, or oi shall ’ate ’ee! No one ’as no
call t’ be so clean as oi be ’cept p’r’aps in theer coffins—an’
even then I dunno! Theer was Joel Sams, never
kemped ’is ’air in arl ’is days, oi du believe, never
shaved—not ’im! Only washed of a Sunday ’cos
’is woife made ’im ... a reg’lar loight-’earted chap
were Jo tell ’e took an’ doied. Well, when I come to
’elp ’im intu ’is coffin, they’d washed ’im an’ breshed
’im an’ shaved ’im till oi didn’t roightly know whether
’e were the corp’ or no.... An’ they’d made ’is
coffin too small, but in ’e ’ad to go. So oi doubled
’im ’ere, an’ oi twisted ’im theer, an’ got ’e in some’ow—oi
knawed pore Joel wouldn’t moind.... An’ talkin’
o’ corpses, wot about your sweet-’eartin’, young
man?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, it progresses as well as can be expected.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but ’ow much do ye expect, young man, that
be the p’int. Theer’s folk as generally-arlways
expects too much, an’ theer’s folks as doan’t never
expect nothin’ no’ow ... loike Diggory Small’s
woife as never expected an’ wouldn’t expect ... said
’twas nowt but wind ’er did ... an’ so when the child
were born everybody called it ‘Windy Small,’ which
were ’ard on the child seein’ as Diggory ’ad ’ad it
named ‘Noble’ arter Farmer Axeford’s gurt cow....
An’ talkin’ o’ cows, Pen ’aryott’s witched ’er
ol’ cottage into a noo ’un, she ’ave ... arl noo painted
an’ thatched so trig as never was, it be. Which
ain’t nowise nat’ral—not in Dering it bean’t, wheer no
cottages bean’t never painted nowhen. So ’tis witchcraft
sure-lye, spells an’ black magic, I rackon—unless
it be the doing o’ liddle Mus’ Dobbs.”</p>

<p>“And pray, who is he?” inquired Sir John lazily.</p>

<p>“Lord!” exclaimed the Aged Soul in deepest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
scorn, “oi wouldn’t ha’ beleft as nobody nowheers
didn’t know ’e. Mus’ Dobbs be a liddle ol’ chap as
bean’t a pharysee an’ yet moighty loike a pharysee tu,
as works an’ labours whoiles folks sleep.... An’
yonder be that ’ere sweet-eart o’ yourn at last
akerchally a-kissin’ ol’ Pen goo’-bye! An’ a rare
purty lass ’er be tu! Moves so free an’ easy as a young
blood-mare, doan’t ’er? Carries ’er ’ead ’igh an’
proud-loike! A foine wench she be sure-lye....
Nay, boide wheer ye be, young man, oi’ll go to ’er
d’rackly-minute an’ say a word for ’ee, aye I will so.
’Tis loike enough oi’ll arg’ ’er into weddin’ of ’ee afore
she knows it, so boide wheer ye be an’ leave it arl
to oi.”</p>

<p>So saying, the Aged One hobbled away, and Sir
John, seated beside the stile, watched the little old
man salute my lady with hat a-flourish and, bare-headed,
offer her his arm.</p>

<p>The sun had set, but earth and heaven were still
glorious with his passing; from blooming hedge,
fragrant meadow and open down stole a thousand
scents that seemed but to strengthen as the shadows
fell, a mingled sweetness upon the warm, still air;
borne to his ears came the lowing of cows calling to
be milked, the plod of horses jingling stablewards,
friendly voices murmurous with distance, and an
intermittent rustling in the opposite hedge. And Sir
John, seated beside the old stile, breathing this warm
and fragrant air and hearkening to these peaceful
sounds, was none the less suddenly chilled by an
intuitive sense of impending evil and turned instinctively
to glance towards the opposite hedge where it grew
very dense and high, shutting the road from the
little spinney beyond. Watching this, it seemed that
something crouched there, a something that moved
stealthily ever and anon; and there grew within him
an uncomfortable feeling that he was watched by
unseen eyes, and with this, a consciousness of ever-growing
peril. So he sat with head bowed as one in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
thought, but with eyes keenly watchful and ears heedful
of that intermittent rustling so soft and yet so purposeful.
For some while he remained thus, his every
faculty alert though the leafy stir had ceased and
nothing to be heard except the plaintive evensong of
the birds.... And yet, was there something that
moved again beyond the hedge, something that crept
nearer and ever nearer with a dreadful patient slowness?
A dog? No! A sheep? Perhaps! A
man? Well, whatever it was, would soon be directly
opposite where he sat, surely it was there already.
Once again came a sound of stealthy movement as of
something gently forcing itself a passage towards him
through the hedge itself....</p>

<p>Sir John cocked the small pistol in his pocket and
waited, his eyes grown suddenly fierce. A dog barked
in the distance, a sheep-bell tinkled faintly ... and
then was a sound of light footsteps near by and Ann
Dumbrell came slowly along the lane and paused near
by, her gaze intent upon some distant point, as one
who awaited an expected presence; then Sir John,
himself unseen where he crouched, beheld her start,
saw her hands clasp each other, heard the fall of quick-striding
feet that paused suddenly and then came on
again, but more slowly.</p>

<p>“Why, ’tis never you, Mus’ Doubleday?” she
exclaimed as one amazed by some phenomenon.</p>

<p>“None other, Mrs. Ann,” answered the Corporal,
halting and surveying her shy loveliness with gloomy
eyes. “You see,” he explained, “it so happens as
I ... chanced to be ... coming this way and ...
well, here I am, mam!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mus’ Doubleday. An’ us be arlways pleased
to see ’ee whenever it be ... though granfer bean’t
in yet.... I—I were just agoing tu look for ’e.
An’ ’ow be you, sir?”</p>

<p>“As well as can be expected!” he sighed dismally.
“Lord love me, Mrs. Ann, but ye look younger than
ever this evening!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“But I be older than I were this marnin’, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why, so you told me yesterday,” answered the
Corporal reproachfully, his gloom deepening, “an’
yet here y’ are this evening lookin’ younger than
ever!”</p>

<p>“O Mus’ Doubleday,” she laughed, “’ow may that
be? I were a liddle baby once, an’ looked younger
then, I rackon.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” said the Corporal bitterly—“I wish that
you—no, I wish that I had been—but what’s the use
o’ wishing? Only ... if you had only been a ...
bit older ... if only you had——”</p>

<p>“Aye, an’ what then, sir?” she questioned eagerly.</p>

<p>“No matter, mam.”</p>

<p>“But, Mus’ Doubleday, I du be a-growin’ older an’
older every day!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” groaned the Corporal, “so am I!”</p>

<p>“An’ yonder comes grandfer along o’ Mrs. Rose!
She be rarely ’andsome, don’t ’ee think?”</p>

<p>“So, so!” sighed the Corporal.</p>

<p>“O Mus’ Doubleday! I’m sure she’s the rarest
beauty!”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” admitted the Corporal, “only I don’t
’appen to ha’ noticed.”</p>

<p>“But you got eyes, sure?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I have,” nodded the Corporal, looking at
pretty Ann until she blushed again, “an’ I think I
know a fair lass when I happen to see one, but ...
being a man o’ forty-five winters, mam, an’ no young
galli-vantin’ lad, I looks, and thinks, and says nothing.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, Mus’ Doubleday,” sighed she, “won’t
’ee come an’ say it indoors—afore grandfer sees us?”</p>

<p>And so they passed on, walking very close together,
though the Corporal resolutely kept his hands buried in
the deep side-pockets of his coat.</p>

<p>Then Sir John arose lazily and made a great business
of yawning and stretching, though keeping well in the
shadow of the tree behind him, and presently sauntered
along the lane to where the thick hedge opposite was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
pierced by a gate. Here his manner underwent a
sudden change; in a flash he had vaulted the gate, and,
pistol ready, crouched where he might behold the other
side of this rustling hedge.... No one! And yet
how should a hedge rustle so very persistently and no
wind stirring? And now his quick glance saw that
which answered the question beyond all doubt: the
place was a tangle of lusty weeds and wild-flowers that
stood very dense and lush save immediately behind the
hedge, for here they showed bent and broken as by the
recent passage of a heavy body, a narrow trail, following
the line of hedge, a betraying track that swung off at a
right angle towards the leafy solitude of the little
spinney. Had baffled Murder crept that way? Did
it skulk there still?</p>

<p>Staying not to debate the point, Sir John set hand to
gate and vaulted back into the lane—to the vociferous
indignation of Mr. Dumbrell, for being startled by this
so sudden appearance, the Aged Soul stamped and
swore and shook his stick at Sir John in highly ferocious
manner.</p>

<p>“Dannel ye!” he snarled. “Will ’ee goo for tu
frouden a old, aged, ancient soul as would be j’yful
tu be a-diggin’ your grave for ’ee d’rackly-minute?
’Tidn’t respectful, no! Dannel ’ee twoice!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’ee can go on a-beggin’; ’ee wun’t get no
pardon from oi. A-jumpin’ out ’pon a aged man as
’ave been a-makin’ love fur ’ee till oi du be nigh
black i’ the faace!”</p>

<p>“Then I am deeply grateful, and——”</p>

<p>“Aye, an’ oi told a mort o’ loies fur ’ee, oi did!”</p>

<p>“Lies?”</p>

<p>“Aye, didn’t oi tell ’er you was a-poinin’ fur ’er—an’
you ain’t! Didn’t oi tell ’er as the best o’ food
sech as beef an’ pork wouldn’t nowise lay easy on your
stummick arl along o’ her? Didn’t oi tell ’er as you
was a foine, up-standin’, ’andsome young felley—which
you ain’t—not by no manner o’ means, an’ that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
if she didn’t mak’ sure of ’ee, there was a mort o’ purty
lasses arl ready for to snap ’ee up? Which they ain’t.
An’ now ’ere be you a-doin’ your best to frouden a
pore, ancient creeter into ’is grave afore ’is toime!...
D’ye call that gratitood?”</p>

<p>“Forgive me!”</p>

<p>The Aged Soul snorted.</p>

<p>“Arl of a trimble oi be. The next lass as you think
o’ marryin’, you can woo ’er yourself—doan’t ax oi!
Ah, an’ oi be glad now as she said what she did say!”</p>

<p>“And what was that, Ancient One?”</p>

<p>“Says as she’d wait and see which o’ they purty
lasses would snap at ’ee first, she did.... An’ I
rackon she’ll ’ave to wait a tur’ble long time.”</p>

<p>“And pray, where is she now?”</p>

<p>“A-settin’ ’long o’ my granddarter an’ Mus’ Doubleday,
fur sure.”</p>

<p>But my lady was leaning upon the old stile, and fresh
from the sighful confidences of shy Ann in the little
kitchen and the Corporal’s halting disparagement of
the age forty-five in the little garden, was thinking only
of him for whom she waited, of herself and the future;
thus when hearing his step she glanced up, Sir John
saw that in her look which stirred him to such joyous
wonder that he yearned to clasp and kiss her then and
there; but she, aware of this, drew back, so truly
shy and off her guard for once that she quite forgot to
act. So he turned and took the little, old man by the
shoulders instead.</p>

<p>“O Mr. Dumbrell!” quoth he rapturously; the
old man snorted. “Aged Soul!” Mr. Dumbrell
scowled. “Friend Hosea!” The old man stared.
“To-day my respect of thee mounteth high as heaven
... thou’rt a far better wooer than I dreamed!
So shall sit in comfort all thy days henceforth. And so
good-night, my ancient Hosea, thou honoured, Aged
Soul—good-night!”</p>

<p>Then Sir John vaulted the stile, aided my lady
over, and side by side they set out for Alfriston through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
a peaceful countryside glorious with sunset. Forgotten
now the sinister rustling of hedges and all else under
heaven save the sweet, shy droop of her lashes so new
in his experience of her, for here no longer was prideful
coquetry full of modish affectations, but rather the
Rose-child of his dreams, and what else could matter
so long as her hand lay thus within his arm and her
foot trod with his the velvet ling.</p>

<p>“Rose,” said he, halting suddenly, “a while ago love
looked at me from thine eyes.... O child, come, kiss
me!” And then his arm was about her; but, though
very conscious of the tender yearning of his voice, and
even while yielding to the mastery of his arm, she
laughed a little unsteadily.</p>

<p>“Indeed, John, the Aged Soul did plead thy cause
so irresistibly ... it seems thou canst neither eat nor
sleep ... he told me thy—thy ‘innards be arl shook
to pieces with love’ ... he urged the woes o’ thy
poor stomach so passionately that I looked to see him
weep....”</p>

<p>“Hum!” quoth Sir John; and then: “Rose,
when will you marry me?”</p>

<p>“This depends on how long you intend playing the
part of John Derwent, sir.”</p>

<p>“And this again, Rose, depends on how soon my
Lady Herminia will marry Sir John Dering.”</p>

<p>“Nay, first, John, she is determined on wedding my
Aunt Lucinda to your friend, Sir Hector.”</p>

<p>“’S life, and is she so, child?” he exclaimed a little
ruefully. “’Faith, ’tis like the contrary Herminia,
for here is plaguy difficult problem.”</p>

<p>“And yet should be easily resolved betwixt us,
John.”</p>

<p>“Nay, but the Duchess called Sir Hector an ogre,
and he blenches at mere mention of her name....”</p>

<p>“To be sure, John, the situation is very promising
and needeth but a little dexterous management. You
will prompt Sir Hector, I’ll plague my aunt ... is’t
agreed, John?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p>“It is!” he laughed. “And now—come, kiss
me?” But she held him off, viewing him grave-eyed.</p>

<p>“John,” said she solemnly, “to-day old Penelope
was monstrous strange and full of foreboding on your
account ... ’twas as she knew some danger threatened.
But it is all so sweetly peaceful, what should harm you
here?”</p>

<p>“What indeed?” he answered, glancing furtively
towards the lengthening shadows behind them.</p>

<p>“And yet old Penelope was so awesome o’ speech
and look.... I can mind her every word: ‘He hath
raised what only blood can lay!’ said she. Sounds not
this dreadful, John? And then: ‘Bid him beware
the peril o’ solitary places,’ quo’ she, ‘of things that
creep i’ the dark! Day and night bid him look behind
him wherever——”</p>

<p>My lady paused suddenly, for Sir John was indeed
glancing back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>They had crossed the stile beyond the little footbridge
and were following a path bordered by dense
underbrush and shaded by tall trees. Sir John’s quick
ear had caught a faint creak such as a stealthy foot
might make on the rickety planking of the bridge;
moreover, his eyes had glimpsed a vague shape that
flitted unheard among the brush.</p>

<p>“John,” said my lady breathlessly, “why d’ye look
so?... Ah, what is it?” And he winced beneath
the pressure of her fingers upon his wounded arm.</p>

<p>“Pray loose me!” he whispered, and slipped hand
into pocket.</p>

<p>“John,” she breathed, “tell me what cometh
yonder?”</p>

<p>“Nay, this I must discover,” he answered, and loosed
her hands, for now, plain to hear, was a faint rustling
amid the brush.... And then she had leapt between
Sir John and this scarce-heard, unseen thing, had twined
strong arms about him, holding him so close that
he might sense all the fragrant warmth of the soft
and pliant body that shielded his; thus stood they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
awhile, her soft cheek against his, and now he could
feel the heavy beating of her heart against his own.
The stealthy rustling came again, crept nearer, paused,
crept past them, died away, and nothing to be heard
except the melodious murmur of the brook hard by.
And then my lady spoke, her voice low but undismayed:</p>

<p>“’Tis gone, I think, and.... O John!”</p>

<p>His arms were about her, straining her closer yet,
and when he spoke his voice was strangely hoarse and
shaken:</p>

<p>“O thou dear, brave soul! Thou very woman!...
Yon creeping terror hath shown thee greater,
nobler than I dared dream thee!... When, when
wilt marry me?”</p>

<p>“Nay, John,” she answered gently, “how may I
tell thee this till thou ask Herminia?... Go to her,
John, seek and woo the poor, despised, solitary soul.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I will—but when? Where?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow afternoon, John, at the cottage ...
and come as Sir John Dering.”</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW THEY WARNED CAPTAIN SHARKIE NYE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Dusk was falling as Sir John paused beside the old
cross whose worn base chanced to be propping
divers and sundry brawny backs: Mr. Muddle leaned
there side by side with Mr. Pursglove; there also were
Messrs. Godby, Unstead and Comfort, each and all of
whom seemed extremely wide awake and more than
usually talkative notwithstanding the pervading
drowsiness of the warm, stilly air.</p>

<p>“G’d evenin’, Mus’ Derwent; tur’ble waarm it do
ha’ been to-day sure-lye,” quoth Mr. Muddle.</p>

<p>“Though theer was a bit o’ wind stirrin’ ’bout
’leven o’clock ’s marnin’,” added Mr. Pursglove.</p>

<p>“Aye, but it doied awaay it did, afore twalve,”
said Mr. Godby.</p>

<p>“Rackon my peas’ll do naun good ’appen it doan’t
rain,” opined Mr. Comfort.</p>

<p>And yet Sir John knew instinctively that it was
neither to discuss the unusual heat of the weather nor
Mr. Comfort’s languishing peas that had brought them
hither in murmurous conclave.</p>

<p>And surely it was no very extraordinary sight to
behold Parson Hartop ambling up the street on his
plump steed, even though Mr. Pym strode at his stirrup,
and yet the four worthies seemed vaguely uneasy none
the less.</p>

<p>Reaching the cross, Mr. Hartop drew rein and Mr.
Pym, grounding the long musket he carried, wiped
perspiring brow.</p>

<p>“Is George Potter hereabouts?” he inquired in
accents discreetly modulated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p>“No, Mus’ Pym.”</p>

<p>“Then you must find him—at once!”</p>

<p>“Aye, Mus’ Pym ... but whoy, sir, an’ wherefore?”</p>

<p>“Tell ’em, Hartop!” said the painter.</p>

<p>“Friends,” said the parson, leaning down from his
saddle and addressing them much as if it had been a
pulpit; “ye refractory souls, we be all of us human
and therefore prone to err. But for myself, having the
cure of souls among ye, I regard ye all as my wayward
children, and, when I see ye rushing blindly on destruction,
hold it my bounden duty to warn ye thereof....
Hark ye, then! Cuckmere Haven is watched
to-night! There be many soldiers hidden there and
upon the cliff. I have seen them with my own eyes;
heed therefore my word! Pass the warning to your
fellows, and thereafter let each o’ ye seek your beds
with due gratitude to that ever beneficent Providence
that by my humble means hath, yet again, saved ye
from dire peril o’ your bodies.”</p>

<p>“In a word,” added Mr. Pym, “the Preventives ha’
been warned somehow and are out in force, and but for
our parson would ha’ shot or taken every man o’ ye!”</p>

<p>“One other matter,” sighed Mr. Hartop; “you will
tell George Potter, most wayward of all my children,
that next time he is necessitated to use the church
tower he will leave space for the bell-ropes to play
freely: on the last occasion, as you will doubtless
remember, the tenor bell could not be rung up.”</p>

<p>“Arl roight, Mus’ Hartop, sir, an’ thank’ee koindly!
Ye see, ’twere one o’ they liddle tubs, sir, as went an’
jammed hisself, Mus’ ’Artop, sir. An’ a praper parson
ye be, sure-lye.”</p>

<p>“Aye, a moighty good passon to we, sir. A true
gen’leman as do ever tak’ our part, you be, sir.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” sighed Mr. Hartop. “Alas, that ye should
need me so to do!... Pray show more care hereafter
as regards my bells ... and mind, home all o’
ye, and forget not your prayers.... Good-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>So saying, Parson Hartop saluted them all with
lifted hat and ambled away, whereupon the four
worthies, big with the news, hasted forthwith to the
‘Market Cross Inn.’</p>

<p>“Ha!” quoth Mr. Pym, leaning upon his musket
and looking after the parson’s retiring figure. “Said I
not we were all smugglers hereabouts, Mr. Derwent?
And yonder goeth the best of us all, a truly saintly
man, sir. And now for Potter.”</p>

<p>They found the inn agog with the tidings.</p>

<p>“Guid save’s a’!” exclaimed Sir Hector, “what o’
poor Sharkie Nye?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir,” answered Mr. Bunkle, the philosopher,
“never worrit! Life hath its downs as well as its ups,
an’ Sharkie’ll never put in shore wi’out the signal.”</p>

<p>“But this looks like treachery, Peter!” fumed Sir
Hector. “And syne they ken sae muckle ’tis vera
like they’ll ken the signal likewise. Whaur’s Geordie?
I maun hae a world wi’ Geordie Potter. Whaur bides
he, Peter man?”</p>

<p>“A sight nigher than ’e seems, sir!” answered Mr.
Bunkle and, winking, led them into his inner, much-doored
holy of holies. Here he rapped certain times
upon the panelling, and rap answered him; thereafter
one of the five doors opened and Mr. Potter appeared,
placid as ever and surprisingly neat, except for a
cobweb adhering to one newly trimmed whisker.</p>

<p>Upon hearing Mr. Pym’s news, he grew profoundly
thoughtful and stood awhile staring into the fire.</p>

<p>“Sir Hector be right, I rackon!” said he at last.
“’Tis a spy’s work, sure-lye ... an’ there be only
one way to mak’ sarten an’ that be to go theer——”</p>

<p>“Do ’ee mean Cuckmere ’Aven, Jarge?”</p>

<p>“Aye, Peter, I do. I be a-goin’ d’rackly-minute to
watch. If they shows the signal light a-swing from
cliff, I’ll know ’tis a spy ... an’ must warn Sharkie
off——”</p>

<p>“Aye, but how, Jarge?”</p>

<p>“Wi’ this, Peter.” And from a pocket of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
frieze coat Mr. Potter drew a short-barrelled, heavy
pistol. “I wait till Sharkie be within ’ail and let fly
... flash’ll warn ’im.... An’ noo I’ll be a-goin’——”</p>

<p>“An’ I’m wi’ ye, Geordie man!” quoth Sir Hector,
reaching for his hat.</p>

<p>“And I,” said Sir John, clapping on his own.</p>

<p>“Why, Lord love ’ee, gen’lemen,” exclaimed Mr.
Potter, “’twon’t be nowise easy-goin’! I be for short
cuts ’cross Down, ship-tracks an’ hidden ways.”</p>

<p>“No matter,” answered Sir John.</p>

<p>“An’ what’s more, sirs, dappen us reaches Cuckmere
in time, when I fires to warn Sharkie ’tis but to be
expected as they Preventive lads’ll fire back at me
... so ’tis best I go alone, I rackon——”</p>

<p>“Hoot-toot, Geordie, ye’re wastin’ an’ awfu’ lot o’
wind; save it tae better purpose, man, for we’re
gangin’ wi’ ye.”</p>

<p>“And I also,” said Mr. Pym, examining the flint of
his musket.</p>

<p>“Why, then, come your ways, sirs,” said Mr. Potter;
“but if we be took, ’tis as smugglers you’ll be
sarved——”</p>

<p>“And why not?” retorted Mr. Pym argumentatively.
“Are not all Sussex folk smugglers at
heart—aye, and mankind in general, for matter o’
that?”</p>

<p>“Well, good fortun’ go wi’ ye, sirs,” said Mr.
Bunkle. “’Twill be middlin’ dark; moon doan’t rise
till three o’clock.... An’ there’ll be a bowl o’
summat ’ot waitin’ agin your return. You ought to
be back inside two hours, eh, Jarge?”</p>

<p>“Why, as to that, Peter,” answered Mr. Potter in
his placid manner, “what is to be, will be, I rackon!”
And opening a door he led them forth by a discreetly
unobtrusive passage that brought them to a back
lane, to a footpath skirting the rope walk, and so to
a steep upland, rising against the stars.</p>

<p>Once clear of the village, Mr. Potter went at a pace
that Sir John found somewhat trying by reason of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
difficult country. Moreover, his hurt arm irked him;
but Mr. Pym strode unfaltering, up hill and down,
despite the heavy musket he bore, and Sir Hector’s
long legs seemed tireless.</p>

<p>Though there was no moon as yet, the stars made
a palpitant glow, a glimmering dusk wherein all objects
loomed up vague and unfamiliar. To Sir John the
dim forms of his silent companions seemed like
phantoms in a phantom world; stumbling and breathless
he struggled on, feeling as one in a nightmare,
conscious of spectral shapes that reached out ghostly
arms, or touched him with clammy fingers—things
that by day were trees and bushes, but now were
things very evil and sinister.</p>

<p>On he stumbled, sometimes treading the dust of
a road, but mostly they seemed to be climbing or
descending some grassy slope.</p>

<p>Mr. Potter went by ways known only to himself;
he led them through narrow lanes deep-sunk in the
chalk, through black alleys roofed by tangled thickets
and dense-growing bushes, leafy tunnels sweet with
honeysuckle; up and up and down steep, thymey
slopes, across lush meadows where the feet sank deep,
past brooks that gurgled sleepily in the dark; on and
ever on, reeling and sweating through a windless
darkness, until, breasting a slope, there met them a
sweet, cool breath and to their ears came the hoarse
murmur of the sea. Then Mr. Potter halted, and
when he spoke it was in a whisper:</p>

<p>“Yonder lays Cuckmere, sirs ... tide’ll be at
flood in ’arf an hour, I rackon, an’ the <i>True Believer</i>
should be a-layin’ hove-to out yonder. Afore Sharkie
stands in he’ll show two lights—white above red,
which means, ‘Is arl clear?’ Then, if there be spies
yonder they’ll swing a lanthorn from the cliff, which
means, ‘Arl clear.’ So bide ye here, sirs, an’ watch
fur Sharkie’s signal whiles I tak’ a look round. But
dappen ye see Potter’s wepping flash, why, then—run
for your lives ... an’ softly it be!” So saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
Mr. Potter dropped upon hands and knees, crawled
away and vanished.</p>

<p>Sir John, panting upon the grass, could make out
the loom of precipitous cliff, the vague line of shore,
the white foam of incoming tide; upon his right hand
crouched Mr. Pym, the barrel of his musket cutting
across the stars, upon his left knelt Sir Hector, bulking
more gigantic than nature in the dimness; and then
he was startled by Mr. Potter’s voice immediately
behind him:</p>

<p>“Back, sirs, back an’ easy it is, for y’r lives!...
They sojers be right afore us—thick as mushrooms
... aye, thick as ’rooms they be, so easy it is, sirs ...
we must to the beach ... foller Potter, sirs ... an’
tread cautious!”</p>

<p>Gliding like phantoms, they followed whither Mr.
Potter led, while ever the beat of the incoming waves
grew louder. Suddenly beneath Sir John’s foot a
piece of rotten driftwood snapped, seeming to him
loud as a pistol-shot, and he stood, breath in check,
half expecting a hoarse challenge and the roaring
flash of musketry; instead, he heard Mr. Potter’s
whisper:</p>

<p>“Lay down, sirs ... easy! Now watch the sea
yonder!”</p>

<p>To Sir John, thus outstretched, hearing only the
throb of his own heart and remembering all those men
who lay so murderously silent, so patiently watchful
and expectant, it seemed that looming cliff and vague
foreshore were places of supreme horror, since death
lurked there; the very night seemed foul of it.</p>

<p>And then came Mr. Potter’s soft, untroubled
whisper:</p>

<p>“Yonder, sirs!... Yonder cometh Sharkie
Nye!... D’ye see yon twinkle?... Up she
swings—the white!... Now the red! Aye, yonder
lays the <i>True Believer</i> hove to an’ waitin’ the answerin’
signal.... Watch the cliff, sirs——”</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke, was an answering beam of light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
upon the grim headland, a light that winked once or
twice and then was swiftly lowered until it hung
suspended half-way down the cliff.</p>

<p>“O Geordie-man—O Geordie!” whispered Sir
Hector. “’Tis betrayed ye are, lad—yon proves it
beyond a’ doot!”</p>

<p>“Aye, by the Pize,” whispered Mr. Potter, “yonder’s
black treachery! A light a-top o’ cliff any fule might
show ... but a light a-dangle ’arf-way down!...
Look, sir—God love us ... Sharkie be a-standin’
in——”</p>

<p>“To his death, Geordie—himsel’ and a’ his lads!”</p>

<p>“Not whiles Potter can waarn ’em, sirs!” And,
speaking, Mr. Potter got to his knees, but there Mr.
Pym’s grip on his leg arrested him.</p>

<p>“What’s to do, George?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Liddle enough, sir, but arl I can.... Potter be
a-goin’ down yonder to th’ edge o’ the tide, an’ soon as
they be nigh enough I lets fly with both my pistols——”</p>

<p>“And commit suicide, George Potter!”</p>

<p>“Why, they sojers may miss me, sir ... an’ I shall
run amazin’ quick and—hark, sir ... Sharkie be
a-towin’ in wi’ his boats!” Sure enough, faint though
distinct was the sound of oars.</p>

<p>“Lord love me!” exclaimed Mr. Potter, his
placidity quite gone. “They be closer ashore than I
thought ... loose my leg, sir!”</p>

<p>“Not so, George!” answered the painter. “Your
plan is extreme clumsy and offers but problematical
chance o’ success whiles you run great risk o’ wounds or
death, and Captain Nye may be nothing advantaged.
Now, upon the other hand——”</p>

<p>“Mus’ Pym, Mus’ Pym, it be no time to arg’—lemme
go, sir!”</p>

<p>“Heark’ee now, George Potter, ’twill take Sharkie
Nye some half-hour to tow into musket-shot in this
dark whiles yon lanthorn, though a fairish distance, is
yet well within range ... nay, patience, George, lie
still and listen to me! The trouble seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
yonder lanthorn—very well, let us incontinent extinguish
yon lanthorn....”</p>

<p>“Aye, but how, sir—how?”</p>

<p>“Hold thy tongue, George, and give me elbow-room.”</p>

<p>“Why—why, Mus’ Pym,” gasped Potter, “you
never think as you can manage ... so fur ... sich
a liddle bit of a thing as yon lanthorn?”</p>

<p>“With a bow and arrow, George, which was a
weapon of less precision than such musket as mine,
the worthy Tell split an apple imposed upon his small
son’s head ... and to-night ... hum! Give me
room, George!”</p>

<p>Mr. Pym extended himself comfortably at full
length; they heard the sharp click as he cocked his
long piece, watched him level it across convenient rock,
held their breaths while he dwelt upon his aim; a
spurt of fire, a roar that reverberated far and wide,
a puff of smoke ... and the swinging light was not.
Ensued a moment of utter stillness, then from seaward
came an answering flash, hoarse commands, the red
and white lights vanished, and thereafter a riot of
sound as the gloom of cliff and foreshore was stabbed
by musketry fire; and, lying face down upon the grass,
Sir John heard the whistle and hum of bullets in the
air above him.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried Potter. “Run fur it, sirs, whiles
they reload.... They marked Mus’ Pym’s flash an’
some on ’em’s arter us—so quick it be!”</p>

<p>A panting minute or so across smooth turf, a
stumbling descent, a desperate scrambling over loose
pebbles, a breathless race across wet sand, a groping
among boulders ... and Sir John found himself
alone; he was standing thus, staring dazedly about
him, in his ears the shouting of his nearer pursuers,
when from the dimness above a long arm reached forth,
a mighty hand grasped coat collar, and he was swung
from his feet, dragged through a rocky fissure, and
found himself crouched beside Sir Hector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>“Aha, Johnnie,” whispered the giant, hugging him
until he blenched with the pain of his arm, “is this no’
a bonny place? They ca’ it Pook’s Kitchen—forbye,
there’s few as kens it ... the De’il himsel’ couldna
find us here, y’ ken.... Whisht, lie ye still, Johnnie;
yon be only Pym a-cursing, an’ sma’ wonder; the puir
gentleman was forced tae leave his gun behind....
O Pymmie-man,” quoth Sir Hector, wedging his vast
bulk deeper into the narrow cave, “’tis a sinfu’, waefu’,
shamefu’ thing ye should hae wasted y’r gifts on paint
when ye wad hae made sic a bonny musketeer!”</p>

<p>“So far as my memory serves,” sighed Mr. Pym the
Painter, “I dropped it just after we crossed the
pebble-ridge.”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>“Beef, sir,” said Mr. Bunkle, laying a slice
caressingly upon Sir John’s plate, “cold
roast-beef, sir, can be ate any’ow an’ anywhen, but
sech beef as this ’ere is best took plain and ungarnished
... though I wun’t deny as a slice or so o’ b’iled-’am
took therewith doan’t go oncommon well, t’other
actin’ upon which an’ bringing out the flavour o’ both,
sir, d’ye see! So shall us mak’ it beef-an’-’am, sir?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly!” answered Sir John, seating himself
at the table.</p>

<p>“Sir ’Ector used t’ swear by my beef-an’-’am,’e did,
but ’e doan’t tak’ ’is breakfast ’ere no more ... a
changed man ’e be, sir.”</p>

<p>“How so, Mr. Bunkle?”</p>

<p>“Well, ain’t you noticed ’is wig, sir?”</p>

<p>“Not particularly.”</p>

<p>“’As it combed an’ curled reg’lar nowadays, ’e
do ... sich a ’appy, careless gen’leman ’e used to be,
but lately ... well, ’e was a-wearin’ ’is second-best
coat yesterday! Ah, a changed man be Sir ’Ector.”
And Mr. Bunkle nodded, winked and departed about
his business.</p>

<p>His breakfast done, Sir John arose and, mindful
of his promise to Herminia, took his hat and sallied
forth for the matrimonial “prompting” of the devoted
Sir Hector MacLean.</p>

<p>His reception was not propitious, for scarcely had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
he stepped across Sir Hector’s threshold than that
gentleman’s voice hailed him reproachfully:</p>

<p>“Whisht, man—y’r boots!”</p>

<p>“What of ’em, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Ye’ve never s’muckle as wiped ’em, John! D’ye
no’ ken wha’ yon mat’s for? Here’s Rose, sweet lass,
slavin’ for an auld sojer-body’s comfort, here’s Wully
Tamson workin’ himsel’ tae skin an’ bane—when her
eye is upon him—an’ here’s ye’sel’, Johnnie, treading
dust a’ aboot the floor! O man, hae a leetle conseederation!”</p>

<p>Sir John, having carefully wiped his boots under Sir
Hector’s strict supervision, took occasion to glance
round and behold the wonders achieved, for indeed
chaos had given place to comfort and a dainty orderliness;
it beamed and shone, it winked and twinkled
in polished brass and silver, it stirred gently in the
curtains at open lattice, it lay in the rugs upon raddled
floor, it gleamed in the polished andirons on the spotless
hearth, and breathed in fragrance from the bowl of
flowers upon the mantel.</p>

<p>“’Tis marvellous what a woman can achieve,
Hector!”</p>

<p>“Some women, John!”</p>

<p>“We be miserable creatures without ’em, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Aye, John, but woefu’ wretches wi’ ’em—generally.”</p>

<p>“Now, talking of Rose——”</p>

<p>“Man, she’s the exception! She’s like a beam o’
sunshine aboot the place ... sae neat, sae sweet ...
an’ cook? Losh, Johnnie, she can roast or boil sae
savoury ’twould mak’ a man wish he were a camel wi’
twa stomachs! An’ there’s Wully Tamson! Wully’s
a changed man ... when fou, whilk is no’ vera often,
he gangs aroond wi’oot his boots an’ sleeps i’ the woodshed.
I’ fegs, Wully Tamson is——”</p>

<p>“But we are talking of Rose.”</p>

<p>“Aye, John, an’ ’tis a gey lucky man ye’ll be tae
win sic a wife! She’s a walkin’ wonder!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>“Very true, Hector. And talking of wives, what of
her aunt, the ... Mrs. Saunders?”</p>

<p>“Aye, an’ what o’ her, Johnnie?”</p>

<p>“Well, is it not reasonable to suppose that the so great
virtues of the niece will be found intensified in the aunt?”</p>

<p>“An’ what then, John?”</p>

<p>“Why, then, seeing I woo the wondrous niece, why
should not you woo the more wonderful aunt?”</p>

<p>Sir Hector very nearly dropped his cherished pipe.</p>

<p>“Me, is it?” he exclaimed—“me woo a wumman?
Me—wi’ ane leg i’ the ... Losh, Johnnie man, are
ye rin clean daft, whateffer?”</p>

<p>“She is a woman of refinement, Hector, and altogether
charming, and as a wife——”</p>

<p>“Whisht, man, ye fair mak’ me blush!”</p>

<p>“And you, Hector, are none so ill-looking—‘when
fresh shaved,’ and your wig combed and ironed.
Thou’rt vigorous and strong as a bull——”</p>

<p>“Will ye no’ hae done, John!”</p>

<p>“And she a delightful creature with the very
charmingest natural complexion and adorable eyes.
You must ha’ noticed ’em when peeping at her.”</p>

<p>“Peeping!” gasped Sir Hector.</p>

<p>“Aye, over the wall.”</p>

<p>“John,” exclaimed Sir Hector, rising and drawing
himself to his gigantic height, “I may, peradventure,
have ... chanced to cast a—a neighbourly glance
over the party-wall occasionally, but—peep, sir? I
scorn the imputation!”</p>

<p>“But i’ faith, Hector, I vow she is well worth
peeping at.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” quoth Sir Hector, reaching hat and cane—“sir,
a MacLean never peeps!” Having said which,
he clapped on his hat and stalked majestically away.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>“Heavens, Herminia, how can you?”</p>

<p>“What, aunt dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p>“Sprawl there like any naughty nymph ... and
your petticoats ... so careless and bold ... showing
the prideful perfection o’ your proportions, the
fullness o’ your forms ... like a graceless Greek
goddess on a vase ... so free! Get up, child, do!”</p>

<p>Herminia laughed and, pillowing head on clasped
hands, stretched shapely limbs voluptuously upon her
grassy couch and stared up dreamily through the
leaves of the apple tree to the cloudless blue.</p>

<p>“Concern me, child!” exclaimed the Duchess,
glancing apprehensively towards the party-wall.
“Suppose he should be prying as usual?”</p>

<p>“He would never see me, dear aunt! He hath
eyes for no one and nothing but you. And small
wonder, for you are looking extreme well o’ late. You
grow younger every day, I swear y’ do ... that
gown, now, becometh you vastly!”</p>

<p>“Mm!” quoth the Duchess, eyeing her niece
warily. “Why this fulsome flattery, pray?”</p>

<p>“’Tis merest truth, aunt. And thou’rt looking
thy best to-day, which is well, for in half an hour I take
thee to meet him.”</p>

<p>“Him, Herminia? Can you possibly mean—him?”</p>

<p>“Him, aunt.”</p>

<p>“That odious ogre——”</p>

<p>“That gentle giant, aunt.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not go, Herminia.”</p>

<p>“I suggest thy little laced cap with the blue ribbands,
aunt.”</p>

<p>“I detest your hateful giant, minx!”</p>

<p>“Blue ribbands set off thy beauteous eyes to admiration,
dear aunt!”</p>

<p>“I say I’ll not go.”</p>

<p>“And thy morocco shoes, aunt dear ... indeed,
thou hast the littlest, prettiest foot i’ the world!”</p>

<p>“I vow I’ll not stir one step to see your odious
giant.”</p>

<p>“Then shall I carry thee, thou sweet atomy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>The Duchess stamped, sat down and frowned, but
when she spoke her voice was surprisingly complaisant:</p>

<p>“My cap with the blue ribbands and my morocco
shoes? So be it, thou wilful wretch—go you and
fetch ’em!”</p>

<p>Herminia yawned, stretched languorously and rose.</p>

<p>“Dearest my aunt,” quoth she, “when thou’rt
happily espoused, forget not ’twas thy loving niece——”</p>

<p>“Tush, minx—begone!”</p>

<p>Herminia went; but scarcely had her stately form
vanished within the narrow doorway than the Duchess
stealthily arose, caught up her sun-bonnet and, opening
the wicket gate in the garden wall, hasted away down
the leafy back-lane.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Sir John was observing his resplendent image in the
mirror; full-skirted, embroidered coat moulded his
graceful slenderness to perfection; his gold-buttoned,
flowered waistcoat was a work of art, white satin small-clothes
and gold-clocked silk stockings offset a pair
of shapely legs; diamonds sparkled in shoe-buckles
and cravat; the long, glossy curls of his peruke fell in
that precise abandon which was strictly <i>à la mode</i>; and
yet his delicate brows were wrinkled in disapprobation.</p>

<p>“They feel distinctly tightish, Bob!” he mourned.
“I’ve grown damnably robust and positively bucolic—horrific
thought! Gad’s my life, I’m as swarthy as
a gipsy! Alack, Bob, where is now my romantic
pallor? How the devil may a man languish soulfully
with a colour like a yokelly ploughman? Vastly
distressing, on my soul it is!”</p>

<p>“A patch, sir?” suggested the imperturbable
one.</p>

<p>“Two, Bob, one at my mouth—exactly here!
Now t’other below my eye—so! Now a dash o’ the
gillyflower essence ... and now my lightest cloak to
veil me from the curious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was Mr. Unstead’s dun cow that did it, on this
wise; chancing to meet the small Duchess in the lane,
this gentle ruminant had thrust forth moist, inquiring
muzzle and puffed in gusty fragrance, whereupon the
Duchess uttered a scream, a ladylike outcry small in
volume as herself, but a cry that was answered none
the less very suddenly and to her own gasping astonishment,
for as she stood, crouched against the mossy
wall, staring fearfully at the dun cow’s perilous horns,
she felt herself caught up, lifted gently and set upon
the broad coping of the wall, whence she looked down
to see the Ogre (in his second-best coat) gently urge
the inquisitive quadruped through an adjacent gate;
which done, and the gate secured, he returned and,
uncovering bewigged head, favoured the Duchess with
a profound obeisance.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he began in his very choicest English, “I
sincerely trust that”—here, suddenly espying her
Grace’s small and very pretty feet, Sir Hector blinked
and resolutely averted his eyes—“that ye’re no’ fashed
or byordinar’ afeart by reason o’ yon coo, mam.
She’s an unco’ gentle creature an’ wadna harm a
babe, mam——”</p>

<p>“But I’m not a babe, sir!” she retorted, crossing
her little feet demurely and making the most of the
pretty things—“far from it, sir! And I detest cows
... especially in lanes! ... cows are so horribly
horny!”</p>

<p>“Why, as to that, mam,” answered Sir Hector a
little vaguely, his glance upon her feet again, “cow’s
horns are a dispensation o’ Providence.... Nature
gave a cow horns——”</p>

<p>“To fright fearsome females, sir! And here sitteth
one perilously perched and full o’ fears lest she fall!
Take her down, sir—instantly,” said the Duchess.</p>

<p>Sir Hector glanced up and down the lane, looked at
the little Duchess and blenched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>“D’ye hear me, sir?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Ou aye, Mrs. Saunders,” he answered. “Hae
patience, mam.... Bide a wee....” And he
turned away; but scarce had he achieved two paces
than she summoned him back imperiously.</p>

<p>“How, sir,” cried she, “will ye leave me—desert
me in this dreadful situation? Heaven help me,
’twould seem I am fated to sit helplessly aloft——”</p>

<p>“A ladder, mem.... I’ve a ladder in my garden.”</p>

<p>“Tush for your ladder, sir! To leave me here—so
heartless and hateful!”</p>

<p>“Heartless, mam! No, no! By means o’ my ladder,
y’ ken——”</p>

<p>“Ha’ done wi’ your ladder, sir!”</p>

<p>“But, losh, mam, hoo wull ye come doon wi’oot my
ladder?”</p>

<p>“How did I get here, pray?”</p>

<p>“Leddy, ’twas a’ by the inspiration o’ the moment.”</p>

<p>“Then pray be ‘inspired’ again, sir.”</p>

<p>Sir Hector flushed, glanced at her little, helpless
feet, her roguish eyes, fumbled with his hat and
dropped it; the little Duchess giggled. Then Sir
Hector took a deep breath and reached out his arms.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Sir John, giving hat and cloak to the placid Betty,
glanced round the small room.</p>

<p>“Pray tell your lady that Sir John Dering awaits
her pleasure,” said he, whereupon Betty curtsied,
dimpled and withdrew, leaving him to shoot his ruffles,
adjust his laced jabot and glance into the mirror a
little anxiously, for now that the moment was at
hand he was conscious of a vague unease, a growing
apprehension that plagued and puzzled him: “How
would she receive him?” Here was the question to
which he found no answer. Thus, for once unsure of
himself, he shot ruffles, adjusted cravat and glanced
into the mirror all over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<p>Then the door opened and she stood before him, a
radiant vision, magnificently gowned, a glorious
creature deep-eyed, red-lipped, vivid with youth and
strength, a woman nobly shaped, assured and confident
in her beauty. Proudly she swept towards him,
closing the door behind her while he stared motionless
and tongue-tied, overwhelmed by the majesty of her.</p>

<p>“Madam!” he murmured at last. “Herminia!”
and he bowed.</p>

<p>“Sir!” said she, and sank down in billowing, gracious
curtsy; but, alas! as she arose her voluminous
draperies caught up a three-legged stool; in freeing
herself of this, her panniers swept a china ornament
crashing to the floor; in turning to scowl at the fragments,
over went the little table, and, startled by its
fall, she caught high heel in embroidered skirt and
would have fallen but for Sir John’s ready aid.</p>

<p>“Faith, my lady,” he laughed, “we creatures of
art be sadly out o’ place among these homely things!
Better my gentle Rose in her simple tire, thy rustical
John in his homespun——”</p>

<p>“Loose me!” she cried passionately, and he was
amazed to see he clasped a raging fury. “Let me
go!” she repeated. Mutely he obeyed, and she fronted
him, pale with anger and mortified pride.</p>

<p>“Nay, Herminia,” he pleaded, “be it satin or merest
rags, thou and only thou art she I love!” And he
would have taken her hands, but she retreated with
superb gesture and, catching the folds of her gown on
the arm of a chair, ripped it irretrievably. At this final
catastrophe she halted between laughter and tears,
but, meeting his look, chose the third alternative.</p>

<p>“Sir, you ... laugh at me, I think?”</p>

<p>“With thee, rather, my lady,” he answered; “for,
O Herminia, an ordinary cottage cramps and cannot
hold us ’twould seem, nay, the whole wide world
were scarce great enough for such love as ours.”</p>

<p>“I pray you speak for yourself, Sir John.”</p>

<p>“Then hear me, Herminia, though verily my love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
transcends all speech and thought, for ’tis of Infinity
itself. With thee beside me life should become more
worthy for thy sake ... without thee ’twere an
emptiness, and death a lovely thing. Marry me,
Herminia; see here upon my knees I supplicate.”</p>

<p>For a long moment Herminia was speechless because
of her heart’s tumultuous beating, her cheeks aglow,
her eyes very tender beneath their drooping lashes;
but from Sir John, thus kneeling in his new humility,
her glance wandered to the shattered china ornament,
the overturned chair, the jagged rent in her gown,
and from her parted lips trilled sudden laughter, and,
or ever she might check it, Sir John was upon his feet,
viewing her beneath wrinkling brows, coldly curious.</p>

<p>“Ah, my Lady Barrasdaile,” said he softly, “in this
sorry world are to be found miserable wretches who,
to vent their puny spite, will foully desecrate the
holiest of holies.... My love was a holy thing, and
you, for your foolish pride’s sake, would make a mock
of it. Here, madam, I read the grand culmination o’
your empty vengeance. Well, so be it. But I tell
you that ‘the Wicked Dering’ at his worst could
never sink to such depths as yours——” At this she
turned and would have left him, but his out-thrust
arm stayed her. “One moment longer, madam!”
he commanded. “Your vengeance is complete, but
... my bitterest scorn goeth with you now and——”</p>

<p>“Your scorn!” she cried in choking voice; and,
seizing his arm that still barred her escape, she wrenched
and twisted it in furious hands until he winced with
the pain of it. “Your scorn!” she panted. “You
whose hands are red with blood!”</p>

<p>“God’s love, madam!” quoth he between pallid
lips. “And was it you indeed who with her own body
would ha’ shielded me from an assassin’s stroke?”</p>

<p>“And is it you would remember a moment of
hysteria?” she retorted passionately.</p>

<p>Sir John recoiled.</p>

<p>“Hysteria?” he stammered. “Hysteria? And was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
it so, indeed? Nay—nay, madam, what mean
ye?”</p>

<p>“That the irresistible Sir John Dering hath met
one woman at the least who doth not succumb to his
wiles and blandishments.”</p>

<p>“Unworthy!” he exclaimed. “Oh, base and most
unworthy!”</p>

<p>But now, the door open at last, she fled from him
and up the narrow stair.... And after some while
Sir John took hat and cloak and stumbled forth into
the golden afternoon, but for him it might have been
blackest midnight.</p>

<p>Her Grace of Connington, returning at last by way
of the wicket gate, stole into the little house, her
bright eyes a little brighter even than usual; but in
the act of laying off her sun-bonnet, paused, arrested
by a sound from the chamber overhead, and, running
up the stair with surprising agility, discovered my
Lady Herminia face down upon the floor among the
ruin of her crumpled finery.</p>

<p>“Why, Herminia ... dear child!” she cried. “O
my love ... my precious soul—what is it?”</p>

<p>“Aunt,” sobbed my lady without lifting her
woeful head, “O aunt ... I’ve trampled him ...
triumphantly ... at last!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI<br />
<span class="smaller">TELLETH OF THE DUEL ON DERING TYE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Reaching the old cross, Sir John paused instinctively
and leaned there, oblivious to all
but this most bitter of truths. She had acted ...
from the very first! The gentle Rose with her sweet
simplicity was no more than a figment of his own
imagining. The cold, vindictive Herminia had lured
him on for this.... Here, indeed, was the culmination
of her heartless scheming. Her vengeance was
accomplished.... And Rose had never existed!</p>

<p>Here, lifting clenched hand, he saw a slow trickle
of blood that crept beneath lace ruffle.... She had
said his hand was bloody ... and to be sure she had
gripped and wrenched his injured arm.</p>

<p>Now as he leaned thus against the cross, watching
these slow-creeping drops, he became aware of hoofs
approaching at a wild gallop, and, glancing up, espied
a horseman who rode very furiously, and it was with
a faint surprise that he recognised Mr. Hartop; on
came the parson, spurring his plump steed mercilessly,
until, perceiving Sir John, he abated his speed
somewhat.</p>

<p>“Sir—sir,” he cried, his voice thin and high, “they
are killing the witch ... old Penelope Haryott!
The mob is out ... my Lord Sayle will do nothing.
They’ve wrecked her cottage.... I’m for Sir Hector
MacLean and any who are men ... pray God we be
in time! You, sir—quick, I beseech ... High
Dering.”</p>

<p>“Sayle?” repeated Sir John. “Is he there?”</p>

<p>“Sir, ’twas by his orders they ransacked her cottage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
seeking the man Potter.... God help the poor soul!
Haste, sir, if ye would be o’ service!”</p>

<p>Next moment Sir John was before the ‘Market Cross
Inn’ shouting for horse, ostlers and the Corporal.</p>

<p>“Sir?” questioned the imperturbable Robert,
hurrying downstairs.</p>

<p>“To horse, Bob, at once! Nay, first my sword
with the rapier blade!” And, unhooking the gold-hilted
weapon at his side, Sir John tossed it upon the
table.</p>

<p>“The one you bid me sharpen, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—and hurry, man, ’tis life and death!”
And away hasted Sir John to see the horses saddled,
to mount and fume at the ostlers until the Corporal
came running, the sword beneath his arm.</p>

<p>“Is’t sharp, Bob, is’t sharp?” questioned Sir John,
as he buckled the weapon on.</p>

<p>“As a razor, your honour, both edges, from the p’int
six inches up——”</p>

<p>“Then up with ye and—spur, Bob!” The Corporal
sprang to saddle, found his stirrups, and, wheeling
the high-mettled animals, they dashed into the street
and away at full gallop: and spur how he would,
the Corporal had much ado to keep Sir John in
sight.</p>

<p>Now presently, as they raced thus, they heard a
distant sound that might have been wind in trees,
a vague murmur that grew upon them with every
stride, waxing ever louder and more terrible, a sound
than which there is surely none more dreadful, the
ferocious, inarticulate roar of an angry mob.</p>

<p>With this awful clamour in his ears, Sir John spurred
his horse to yet faster pace; but across country he
might save half a mile or so; therefore steadying the
mare he set her at a gate, cleared it gallantly, and
away pounded the sorrel at stretching gallop, taking
dykes and brooks in her stride: across and over and
through ditch and fence and hedge, swerving for
nothing, staying for nothing, until, clearing hedge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
and ditch at mighty bound, her fast-galloping hoofs
thundered upon dusty road again.</p>

<p>And presently Sir John saw the thatched roofs of
High Dering, and then he was racing down its winding
street; a moment more and he was upon the Tye or
village green where swayed a tumultuous, roaring
crowd; and in the midst, her white head horribly
bedabbled, a mark for every gibing tongue and merciless
hand, reeled old Penelope Haryott.</p>

<p>And now a demon awoke in Sir John; his modish
serenity was utterly gone, his eyes glared, his teeth
gleamed between snarling lips and, spurring his rearing
horse, he drove in upon the mob, striking savagely
with heavy whip at the faces of such as chanced
nearest: whereupon the full-throated roar changed to
shouts of anger and dismay, to screams of pain and
fear, to a whine. But, spurring upon the shrinking
people, he lashed at them as they had been curs, until
the heavy whip broke in his grasp, and like curs they
ran before him, howling. Then chancing to espy
Mr. Oxham, who stood beside Sturton before ‘The
Dering Arms,’ he wheeled and galloped up to them.</p>

<p>“Rogues!” he panted. “Where’s your master?—where
is Lord Sayle?... Tell him ... Sir John
Dering ... awaits him.”</p>

<p>“Sir John—Dering?” exclaimed Oxham, staring,
while Mr. Sturton, uttering a gasping moan, sank down
upon adjacent bench and bowed his head between
clasping hands. And then Mr. Oxham was pushed
aside and my Lord Sayle stepped from the inn.</p>

<p>Sir John lightly dismounted.</p>

<p>“Ah, my lord,” quoth he, “so I find ye trespassing
and murdering on my land.”</p>

<p>“I am here, sir,” retorted his lordship, scowling,
“in the exercise of my duty. If your tenants be
minded to duck a notorious witch, ’tis no affair o’ mine.
And I warn ye, sir, that in yon old hag’s cottage we
have found indisputable evidence that——”</p>

<p>“Tush!” exclaimed Sir John, “do not weary me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
with the details o’ your man-hunting trade, sir. Your
arm is strong enough to flourish a whip, I perceive,
and mine, you’ll observe, is less sound than it might
be. Come, then, my lord—the grass is smooth and
level on Dering Tye—let us forthwith earnestly endeavour
to make an end o’ one another—for, by
heaven, I’ll wait no longer!”</p>

<p>“Orme,” cried his lordship, “ha’ the goodness to
bring my sword.”</p>

<p>The Major hastened to obey and, taking the weapon,
my lord stepped from under the porch to where Sir
John awaited him; side by side they walked together,
and together reached the smooth green, watched by the
silent crowd, which slowly closed about them until they
stood within a wide ring of hushed and awestruck
spectators. Then Sir John tossed aside laced hat,
drew his sword, tossed the scabbard after the hat,
and, point to earth, watched his lordship do the same;
but scarce was his blade free than Lord Sayle sprang
with glittering point out-thrust, but Sir John, ever
watchful, leapt nimbly aside, avoided the stroke,
laughed, and steel met steel. And, standing thus,
poised, alert, eyes glaring into eyes, blade pressing
blade, Sir John spoke in his high, clear voice:</p>

<p>“A murderous trick, my lord, and worthy of ye.
Now, look around you, note the beauty of this fair
afternoon—’tis your last, my lord, for so sure as you
hold sword, I mean to kill ye!”</p>

<p>The stamp of sudden foot, a flurry of twirling blades
in thrust and parry, and they were motionless again.</p>

<p>“Kill and end ye, my lord!” repeated Sir John.
“But first, for the behoof of our so numerous spectators,
we will show ’em a few gasconading flourishes. Your
coat, my lord, they shall see it flutter in merest rags
about you ere we finish—thus! So ho, my lord,
one—two!” A sudden whirl of close-playing steel,
the flash of darting point, and now, as they thrust and
parried, all eyes might see my Lord Sayle’s brown
velvet disfigured by two gaping rents from waist to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
hem, and from the watching throng rose a hoarse
murmur of amazement. But my lord, nothing dismayed,
fought but the more warily, while Sir John, it
seemed, grew ever the more reckless; ensued long
periods of fierce action, thrust, parry and counter-thrust,
followed by sudden pauses, tense moments
of utter stillness wherein blade felt blade and eye
glared to eye.</p>

<p>Foremost among the spectators loomed the gigantic
figure of Sir Hector, his face suffused and damp, who
babbled prayers as the murderous steel flashed and
darted, while beside him stood Corporal Robert,
deadly pale, who muttered fitful curses.</p>

<p>“Damme, sir, his arm’s begun a-bleeding!” groaned
the Corporal.</p>

<p>“Guid love us a’—so ’tis!” exclaimed Sir Hector,
seizing the Corporal by the collar; “an’ O Rabbie—man,
see how wild he is.... Sayle will hae him
yet!” Here Sir Hector nearly swung the Corporal
from his legs in his emotion.</p>

<p>For, indeed, Lord Sayle’s point time and again flashed
perilously near; once it flickered through the ringlets
of Sir John’s peruke, and once it tore the laces at his
throat, but after every desperate rally it was to be
noticed that my lord’s brown velvet coat showed ever
more woefully tattered.</p>

<p>Suddenly, albeit a little breathlessly, Sir John spoke,
plain for all to hear:</p>

<p>“So much for your coat, my lord! And now for
yourself—let us make an end ... you shall receive
your quietus on the count of three.... One! Two!”
A sudden clashing of desperate steel, then my lord
leapt out of distance and, uttering a hoarse cry of
bitter despair, hurled his useless sword from him and
stood dreadfully pale, bathed in sweat, and, striving
to voice his passionate hate, gasped mouthing
incoherencies.</p>

<p>“Take up your sword, sir—take up ... your
sword and ... let us finish!” panted Sir John.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
But Lord Sayle folded his arms, staring upon his
antagonist with eyes of murder.</p>

<p>Then Sir John laughed.</p>

<p>“What, have ye enough, sir?” he questioned
scornfully. “Are ye done so soon and never a drop
o’ blood, nor so much as a scratch?” Receiving no
answer, he laughed again and turned his back.
“Robert,” he cried—“Robert, see the pitiful fellow
off my land.”</p>

<p>Stung to madness, Lord Sayle reached swiftly for his
fallen sword, but the Corporal was before him and,
snapping the weapon across his knee, tossed the pieces
aside.</p>

<p>“My lord,” said he, “your horse is yonder, I think.”</p>

<p>Lord Sayle raised haggard face from earth to sky,
stared round him upon the gaping throng with expression
bordering on despair, and strode whither
the Corporal’s finger pointed. And, as he went, the
skirts of his brown velvet coat fluttered grotesquely
about him, yet of all who watched, no one spoke, much
less laughed. Reaching his horse, he mounted and,
without one backward glance, gathered up the reins
and, spurring savagely, galloped away, leaving his
friends and servants to follow as they would.</p>

<p>“And now, Hector,” said Sir John, catching up his
hat, “what of old Penelope? How is she?”</p>

<p>“Guid forgi’e me, Johnnie, I clean forgot the puir
soul.”</p>

<p>Reaching the little cottage, they found its new-planted
garden a trampled wilderness, its windows
shattered, its newly painted door battered from its
hinges, and within, a scene of cruel wreckage.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” laughed Sir John fiercely, “my Lord
Sayle yet lives!” And then was a light foot upon the
dark stair and my Lady Herminia faced them, very
pale.</p>

<p>“Guid be thankit ye’re here, my bonny Rose!”
exclaimed Sir Hector fervently. “Hoo is yon puir
Penelope?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span></p>

<p>“Alive, sir! You were in time, I thank God. I
have put her to bed and shall remain with her. I
pray you bid my aunt to me hither and the maid
Betty.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Rose,” cried Sir Hector, catching my lady’s
hands and kissing them, “thou bonny, muckle-hearted
lass! O Johnnie, was there e’er sic a maid as
our Rose?”</p>

<p>“Never, Hector—there never was! For Gad’s my
life, Rose is not, was not, nor ever will be——”</p>

<p>“Eh—eh, Johnnie?”</p>

<p>“The lady before us, Hector, is merely that blooming
‘toast,’ the bewitching Barrasdaile.”</p>

<p>“Losh, man John, wha’s a’ this?”</p>

<p>“This, Hector, is the Lady Herminia Barrasdaile,
niece to her Grace the Duchess of Connington, whom we
know here as ‘Mrs. Saunders.’ But as for our loved
Rose, alas, she was no more than a passing whim!”</p>

<p>“Why—why.... O John!” stammered Sir
Hector, loosing my lady’s nerveless hands and falling
back a step in sheer amazement. “O Rose, my bonny
Rose, wha’s a’ this?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“The truth, sir,” she answered gently. “I am indeed
Herminia Barrasdaile. And now, by your leaves, I
will go back to old Penelope.”</p>

<p>And so, with a gracious curtsy, my lady turned
and went softly up the dark and narrow stair.</p>

<span class="smaller">MR. DUMBRELL MEDIATES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The news of my Lord Sayle’s shameful discomfiture
on Dering Tye ran and spread like wildfire;
in town, village and hamlet near and far it was
the one topic of conversation, in busy market-place,
at cross-roads and sequestered lane, it was discussed;
and ever the story grew.</p>

<p>Dering of Dering was back home again and had
forced Lord Sayle to fight, and cut Lord Sayle’s clothes
from him piecemeal and left him stark naked as he was
born! So ran the story to the accompaniment of
thumping pewter and gusty laughter, and proud
was the man who could boast of having witnessed,
with his own two eyes, the never-to-be-forgotten
scene.</p>

<p>It is to be supposed that my Lord Sayle caught
some faint echo of the tale, for by day he held himself
sullenly aloof, shunned alike by dismayed friends and
trembling servants; but at night, unseen, unheard,
who shall tell the agonies he endured, who describe
the passionate despair, the mortified pride, the futile
rage and burning hate that rent and tore him? All
hell raged within his soul, a hell peopled by demons
that tortured him until came the arch-devil of
Vengeance luring him to his own destruction, urging
him to that black gulf whence there is no return. So
made he Vengeance his comforter.</p>

<p>Yes, Dering of Dering was home again and, mindful
of the treatment it had accorded John Derwent, High<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
Dering was aghast; its women lamented to all and
sundry, its men shook gloomy heads, but none more
despondent than Thomas Nixon, landlord of ‘The
Dering Arms.’</p>

<p>“To think,” sighed he, “to think as I stood ’ere an’
watched Sir John turned out o’ his very own inn off
his very own land! Mak’s me goo arl ’ot and shiversome
it du, neighbours!”</p>

<p>“But then ’ow was ’ee to know ’twas ’im, Tom?”
quoth one of his hearers. “’Ow was any on us to
know?”</p>

<p>“Bah!” snarled the ancient Dumbrell, rapping the
table with his knobbed stick and getting upon quavering
legs. “Everybody ’old their tongues an’ ’ark to
oi!”</p>

<p>“Aye, but ’ow was anybody to know. Gaffer?
’Ow?”</p>

<p>The Aged Soul snorted disdainfully.</p>

<p>“’Ow was you t’ know?” he repeated. “Whoy
by instink fur sure, same as oi did! What if ’e called
hisself Derwent an’ wore a little wig an’ no goold
braid onto ’is ’at? Oi knowed ’e wur quality moment
oi seed ’im, oi did, fur a gen’leman be arlways a
gen’leman!”</p>

<p>“Why that be true enough, Gaffer, but——”</p>

<p>“Hesh!” snarled the Aged Soul. “Don’t goo fur
to arg’ wi’ oi! As fur you, Tom Nixon, ‘whatsoever
a man sows that shall ’e rip!’ You let ’em turn
Sir John Dering out o’ ‘The Dering Arms’ an’ it
be only nat’ral as Sir John Dering’ll turn you out
likewise.”</p>

<p>“Doan’t ’ee say so, Gaffer!” pleaded the mournful
landlord.</p>

<p>“But oi du say so, Tom ... turned out ye’ll be
sure-lye, sarten-sure-indeed, my pore lad, ah—an’
mebbe hung or trans-ported ... unless oi can say a
word fur ’ee to Sir John hisself next toime ’e hap along
to see me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span></p>

<p>“Lemme fill your pot again, Gaffer—do now!”
urged the doleful Mr. Nixon.</p>

<p>“No, no, Tom!” answered the Aged Soul sternly.
“I dunno as I ought to drink wi’ ye at arl—considerin’,
that oi doan’t!”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Nixon groaned, and at this juncture the
Corporal was seen approaching, at sight of whom the
landlord’s depression increased and he looked appealingly
at the little old man, whereupon that Aged Soul
waxed suddenly magnanimous.</p>

<p>“Arl roight, Tom, arl roight!” quoth he encouragingly.
“Sir John be a friend o’ moine, an’ so’s Corporal
Bob. I dunno as oi wun’t put in a word fur ’ee—leave
it arl to oi!”</p>

<p>Thus the Corporal, walking with head bowed as one
in profound reverie, heard himself hailed in piping,
imperious tones, in answer to which he approached
slowly and somewhat unwillingly.</p>

<p>“Mus’ Robert,” quoth the old man, “’ere be Tom
Nixon as stood by whiles Sir John Dering an’ you
was turned out o’ this here inn o’ Sir John Dering’s
an’ consequently ought to be turned out loikewise
immejit, an’ ’ung an’ jibbeted or transported! But
oi moind Tom bein’ barn, an’ a bit of a fule ’e’s been
ever since, an’ consequent I be axin’ you to ax Sir
John to forget an’ forgive pore Tom an’ suffer ’im to
boide on ’ere arl-along-on-account-of pore Tom bein’
naun but a bit fule, d’ye see?”</p>

<p>“Why as to that, Gaffer,” answered the Corporal,
his glance roving afar, “I ray-ther think Sir
John’s forgot the incident; anyway, he don’t bear
malice.”</p>

<p>“Meanin’ as ’e wun’t turn pore Tom out?”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure he won’t,” answered the Corporal,
his gaze still abstracted.</p>

<p>“An’ theer ye be, Tom lad!” quoth the Aged Soul
triumphantly. “See what oi’ve done fur ’ee an’ be
dooly grateful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span></p>

<p>“I be, Gaffer!” answered Mr. Nixon, his gloom
lifted from him. “Lemme fill your pot again. An’ you,
Mus’ Doubleday, what’ll ye tak’, sir?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, thank ye, Nixon,” returned the Corporal,
and his roving glance perceiving the flutter of a petticoat
farther down the lane, he saluted the company
and turned away.</p>

<p>“Robert,” cried the Aged Soul, admonishing finger
uplifted, “if so be ye hap’ to meet my Nan, doan’t ’ee
nowise say nothin’ about this ’ere liddle drop o’ ale,
moind!”</p>

<p>“Not a word, Gaffer!” answered the Corporal,
and strode away.</p>

<p>He found her demurely seated upon rustic bench in
the little garden, busied with her needle and rather
more shyly surprised to see him than usual.</p>

<p>“Why, Mus’ Doubleday,” she exclaimed as he
opened the gate, “you be two hours afore your usual
toime to-day!”</p>

<p>“Two hours four an’ one-half minutes, Mrs. Nan,”
he answered, consulting the ponderous watch he
carried.</p>

<p>“Well, wun’t ’ee come an’ sit down, sir?”</p>

<p>“Thank’ee, Mrs. Ann, I will ... but where,
mam?”</p>

<p>“Here for sure!” she answered, drawing her neat
gown aside and tapping the rustic seat with one finger.
So the Corporal laid by his hat and, seating himself
beside her, remained for a space apparently lost in
contemplation of his riding-boots.</p>

<p>“You be very silent, Mus’ Robert.”</p>

<p>“Aye ... I’m thinking, mam.”</p>

<p>“What about?” she inquired softly, stealing a sly
glance at his down-bent face.</p>

<p>“I was a-thinking, mam, as this be a world o’
change. Aye, life has changed and is a-changing for
me con-siderable!”</p>

<p>“What do ’ee mean, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span></p>

<p>“I mean, Mrs. Ann, that I have lost my place as
Sir John’s valet——”</p>

<p>“Lost it!” she exclaimed aghast. “Lost it—O
Mus’ Doubleday!” Her sewing fell to the ground,
and he would have picked it up but her hand on his
arm checked him. “Lost it?” she questioned again,
whereupon he turned away lest she might read his
truthful eyes.</p>

<p>“Aye, Mrs. Ann,” he mumbled, “Sir John hath
dis-charged me; he ... he don’t want me for his
valet any longer, d’ye see....” The Corporal heard
a soft, inarticulate cry, and then her arms were about
his neck.</p>

<p>“Mus’ Doubleday ... O Robert!” she whispered.
“There, there, never grieve, then—doan’t ’ee! There’s
me left ... arlways me ... an’ I shan’t never
change.”</p>

<p>For a moment he sat motionless, then, forgetting his
imperturbability altogether, Corporal Robert clasped
and drew her to his kisses; and between the two of
them they mightily ruffled his neat wig, whereupon he
snatched it off altogether.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit, lass—wait!” he exclaimed, with a
catch in his voice. “Look, Ann, see how grey my hair
is! I’m too old for ye, my sweet maid.... O Ann,
I’m forty-five and——”</p>

<p>“Why, Bob,” she cried, between laughing and crying,
“as if age mattered—doan’t ’ee be fullish! An’ if
your ’air be a bit grey-like,’tis so I do love it best!”
And, drawing his head down, she kissed him upon each
temple where the hair was greyest. “And so, dear
Robert, if you’ve lost your place wi’ Sir John Dering
you’ve—found me!”</p>

<p>“O Ann—my sweet,” said the Corporal, his voice
more unsteady than ever, “listen a bit more! ’Tis
true Sir John hath discharged me ... I mean as his
valet, but—O Ann ... he’s made me his bailiff
instead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span></p>

<p>“Bailiff?” she gasped. “D’ye mean the same as
Mus’ Sturton was? Wi’ horses to ride ... an’ a
fine house——”</p>

<p>“And you in it, Ann—you in it to make it home.
Though you’re much too young for a wife ... or
I’m much too old——”</p>

<p>“O Bob!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII<br />
<span class="smaller">IN WHICH SIR JOHN DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE MUSE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Dering of Dering being home again and his fame
on every lip, it befell, to Sir John’s dismay,
that the ‘Market Cross Inn’ was generally a-throng with
visitors: sporting farmers who trotted up on their
“bits o’ blood,” country gentry, bucks of the quality,
and not a few ladies of fashion, all hither come to pay
homage in their several ways to “the Wicked Dering.”</p>

<p>To avoid whom, Sir John promptly shut himself
above stairs attended by the Corporal, admitting none
but Mr. Bunkle, adventuring abroad only after dark.
His injured arm still irked him, but this he accounted
nothing compared with the hurt he had suffered at
my lady’s hands.</p>

<p>In this situation he devoted the daylight hours to
the Muse, and penned many and divers satyric pieces
concerning men and manners in general and Woman
in particular, with a view to publication in <i>The Satyric
Spy, or Polite Monitor</i>; while his lampoon on the Sex
entitled, “The Jade Equine and Feminine; or, The
Horse the Nobler Animal,” progressed apace.</p>

<p>It was then upon a sunny afternoon that he laid
down his pen to stare at floor and ceiling and walls,
and finally at Corporal Robert busied with books of
accounts at a small table in adjacent corner.</p>

<p>“Bob,” said he, with a yearning glance towards
the open casement, “a guinea—five guineas for a
suitable rhyme to Herminia!” Hereupon the Corporal
glanced up, scratched his wig, rolled his eyes, and
presently hazarded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>“‘Within ye,’ your honour?”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t grammar, Bob.”</p>

<p>“What o’ ‘Lavinia,’ sir?”</p>

<p>“Rhymes truly but won’t suit.”</p>

<p>“I can’t think of any other, sir.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I, Bob ... ’tis the devil of a name!”</p>

<p>“Then why not choose another, sir?”</p>

<p>“Hum!” quoth Sir John. Here silence again, then:
“What are ye doing there, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Going through estimates for repairs o’ cottages at
High Dering and Selmeston, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Then take ’em for a walk.... She will help ye,
Bob.”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir, she can write as plain as I can, and a
wondrous ’ead for figures—so mar-vellous quick, sir,
and——” Here, meeting Sir John’s quizzical glance,
the Corporal checked and actually flushed.</p>

<p>“And a pretty head it is, Bob! When are ye going
to get married?”</p>

<p>“We thought two months from now, your honour.”
Here Sir John sighed and glanced out of the window.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll be happy, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Thank’ee, sir. I’m pretty sure o’ that.”</p>

<p>Here Sir John sighed more deeply than before, then
frowned as upon the door was a rapping of peremptory
knuckles.</p>

<p>“I’ll see nobody!” quoth he. “No one, you
understand!” Here a louder knocking than ever.
“Dammem, see who dares thus intrude, Bob.”
Obediently the Corporal unlocked, unbolted and
opened the door, when he was immediately caught up,
lifted aside and Sir Hector strode in.</p>

<p>“Losh, Johnnie man,” quoth he, “here’s four days
by an’ never a glimpse o’ ye! An’ wherefore?”</p>

<p>“Because I detest being a raree show to be stared
at by the curious idle, for one thing. And because I
desire solitude for another, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Solitude, is it? Umph-humph! An’ what o’ a’
your loving frien’s?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span></p>

<p>“Meaning yourself, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Ou aye, there’s ever mysel’, John; forbye, there’s
ithers, ye ken——”</p>

<p>“Begging your pardon, sir,” said the Corporal,
taking his hat, “I’ll step along, then, if I may, your
honour?” And at a nod from Sir John he departed,
closing the door carefully behind him, which Sir John
promptly locked and bolted.</p>

<p>“I say, there’s ithers, John!” repeated Sir Hector,
seating himself by the open casement.</p>

<p>“Why, there is Corporal Robert; other friends have
I none, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Dinna be a muckle fule, John! Ye ken vera weel
there’s Mrs. Saund—— I mean the.... Her, for
one, and—abune a’, lad, there’s that sweet, gentle
maid——”</p>

<p>“Whom can you mean, Hector?”</p>

<p>“I mean Rose, an’ weel ye ken it.”</p>

<p>“Rose doth not exist.”</p>

<p>“Well, Herminia, then. She loves ye, Johnnie.”</p>

<p>“Hector, you rave!”</p>

<p>“I tell ye she loves an’ is grieving for ye——”</p>

<p>“A fiddlestick, Hector!”</p>

<p>“The de’il awa’ wi’ ye! I say she’s breakin’ her
heart for ye, John!”</p>

<p>“Impossible! She hath no heart. She is naught
but selfish pride, a creature hard and cold, soulless and
fickle ... in fine, a very woman! And talking o’
The Sex, I have here a small effort in verse that I
venture to think is somewhat felicitous. Hark’ee and
judge!” And, selecting one of the many sheets of
manuscript before him, Sir John read as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old Satan womankind did plan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be the bane and plague of man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And woman since the world began</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Hath been so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, be she, more than common, fair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She is but Satan’s chiefest snare.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherefore, then, of her wiles beware:</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">They bring woe.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>“Hoot awa’!” ejaculated Sir Hector indignantly.
“’Tis rankest blasphemy!”</p>

<p>“’Tis very truth! And faith, it reads better than
I thought. Mark this line, Hector, ‘She is but Satan’s
chiefest snare.’ ’Tis apt, Hector; ’tis well expressed
and should commend itself to all philosophers! Now,
hear the rest—nay, you must and shall! ’Tis brief,
yet pithy.” And Sir John read forthwith:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Therefore, who’d lead a quiet life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unmarred by turmoil, care and strife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Avoid that dreadful thing called ‘wife’;</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">She’ll plague you!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus, is she as Aurora fair;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or eke like night her raven hair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Stead of her I would choose, I swear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">The ague.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“How think you of it, Hector?”</p>

<p>“That it should burn!”</p>

<p>“Nay, rather in due season shall it lighten the page
of <i>The Satyric Spy, or Polite Monitor</i>. Indeed and
verily, Hector, you were right and I was wrong, for
women, as you once truly said, are the devil!”</p>

<p>Sir Hector’s keen gaze wavered for once, and he
stirred uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>“John,” quoth he, precise in his English, “if ever
I voiced such damnable heresy, which I gravely doubt,
I ha’ forgot it, long since, as a man and a MacLean
should.”</p>

<p>“Forgot it, Hector? Amazing! You that have
ever held Woman in such disdainful abhorrence!”</p>

<p>“And suppose I did, sir?” retorted Sir Hector,
flushing. “A MacLean may change his mind and be the
better of it.... And how may I help but revere and
admire The Sex with such an example as Rose, her
sweet and gentle ways——”</p>

<p>“But Rose never was!” sighed Sir John.</p>

<p>“Herminia, then!” snapped Sir Hector.</p>

<p>“Not to mention her aunt!” murmured Sir John.</p>

<p>At this, Sir Hector glared and made to rise, but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
meeting Sir John’s whimsical look, feeling his hand
upon the sleeve of the second-best coat, Sir Hector
flushed, his gaze sought the green of the chestnut tree
beyond the open window, and his grim lips curved
to a smile.</p>

<p>“And ... O man, tae think she’s—a duchess!
’Tis awfu’, Johnnie, awfu’!”</p>

<p>“Alas, Hector, to think she is a woman, and this
is worse. A woman, Hector, and therefore to be
avoided. For, how saith your bard?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘She is but Satan’s chiefest snare.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Umph-humph!” exclaimed Sir Hector, and rose.
“Aweel, lad,” he sighed, “I dinna ken wha’ bee’s in
y’r bonnet regardin’ yon sweet Rose, but——”</p>

<p>“Lady Herminia!” Sir John corrected.</p>

<p>“But look’ee, lad, had it not been for Herminia’s
loving, tender care, Penelope Haryott would ha’
died.... And, talking o’ good women, John, if ever
there was one, it is Penelope.”</p>

<p>“She knew my father, it seems.”</p>

<p>“She did, John.”</p>

<p>“She once showed me two miniatures....”</p>

<p>“Aye, I mind your father having ’em done. Her
likeness he kept always ... it was upon his breast
the day he died! ’Twas that which turned the bayonet
into his heart!... He gave his earliest and, I think,
his best love to Penelope, and she but a cottager’s
daughter born on his estate and twelve years his
senior. But she was beautiful beyond the ordinary,
and good as she was clever, and he wooed vainly ...
even when he would ha’ married her she would not
... because he was Dering of Dering and she only
her pure, humble self.... So, in time he wed your
mother ... and died in my arms ... murmuring—‘Penelope!’
Ah, John lad, if by reason of some misunderstanding
your heart be sore, never decry Woman
... for here, truly, was one of the purest and most
selfless, noblest of creatures!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span></p>

<p>Being alone, Sir John sat thoughtful awhile; at
last he reached for his manuscript, tore it slowly
across and across, and threw it into the fireplace; then,
evening being at hand, he took hat and stick, and,
descending by a back stair, sallied forth into the
fragrant dusk.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV<br />
<span class="smaller">IN WHICH THE GHOST FLITS TO GOOD PURPOSE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It was dark as he reached the old stile hard by the
little footbridge, and, perceiving a shrouded
form thereby, halted suddenly; but as he peered,
uncertain, a soft voice spoke:</p>

<p>“John!” He drew back hastily; the figure moved
towards him. “Sir John Dering?” Off came Sir
John’s hat in a moment, and he bowed profoundly.</p>

<p>“Gad’s my life!” he exclaimed. “Do I indeed
behold your ladyship? Bide you still i’ the country,
madam? A fair good-night to you!” And he
turned away, only to find her beside him.</p>

<p>“Why—why will you hazard your life thus
wantonly?” she questioned. “Nay, sir, do not prevaricate;
I know ’tis your custom to walk thus solitary
of a night.”</p>

<p>“Your ladyship’s interest flatters me!” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Surely, sir,” said she, in the same calm and gentle
tones, “life is not to be thus lightly jeopardised.”</p>

<p>“Tush, madam,” he laughed, “you grow hysterical
again, ’twould seem, and ’tis a weakness of your charming
sex that I have ever found extreme embarrassing,
not to say wearisome. I suggest a pill ... a bolus
and sleep, madam. Aye, sleep is the thing ... you
shall find your megrims gone i’ the morning. So
sleep you soundly, madam, and farewell!” Having
said which, he bowed and departed, leaving her to
watch him through slow-gathering tears. And
suddenly, finding herself thus deserted, she bowed her
stately head upon the old stile, wetting its ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
timbers with her tears and weeping so unfeignedly
that she actually sniffed, though to be sure there was
none to hear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir John, striding his solitary way,
looked up at the stars and smiled happily.</p>

<p>“She cares!” quoth he within himself. “By all
the saints in heaven, she cares!” And, halting
suddenly, he glanced back, minded to return. “Either
she loves me, or here was marvellous good play-acting
... which, now?” Here he went on again,
though very slowly, and coming to a gate, leaned there
to debate the point.</p>

<p>My lady, reaching the cottage, paused awhile, also
with gaze uplifted, but saw the starry firmament
blurred by smarting tears.</p>

<p>“Alas,” sighed she, “he never loved me or he would
have known! He is but the heartless Sir John Dering
after all!”</p>

<p>“The question being,” said Sir John within himself,
his gaze yet uplifted to the firmament, “is she
truly——”</p>

<p>The stars seemed to shoot wildly from their
courses, the earth to sway giddily beneath his feet,
then to plunge horribly down and down into a roaring
blackness.</p>

<p>He awoke to a sense of pain, jolting and strangulation;
slowly he became aware that he lay bound hand
and foot across the withers of a horse, and with his
mouth crammed almost to suffocation with a thing he
took to be a neckerchief.</p>

<p>And after some while he was conscious of two voices
wrangling together—voices these that sounded vaguely
familiar; and the first was hoarse and sullen, the
second sharp and querulous.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The First Voice</span>: An’ whoy not, I sez?</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The Second Voice</span>: Because I won’t have it.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The Second Voice</span>: And I say no!</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The First Voice</span>: My lord bid us mak’ sure, didn’t

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The Second Voice</span>: He’ll be sure enough once

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The First Voice</span>: An’ I tell ye ’e be better dead.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">The Second Voice</span>: And I say, I’ll ha’ no more
bloodshed.</p>

</div>

<p>All about him was the tramp of feet muffled upon
grass; and sometimes it seemed they laboured uphill
and sometimes down, but always these two voices
disputed, now waxing so loud and clear that he seemed
on the point of recognising them, now blurred and indistinct,
sinking to a murmur, a whisper, until they
were not, and it seemed he was asleep and plagued
by nightmare. It was after one of these many lapses
that he was conscious the painful jolting had ceased,
felt himself dragged roughly from the horse’s back,
and had a dim vision of many legs that hemmed him
in as he lay upon the grass.</p>

<p>“Ain’t dead, is ’e?” inquired a hearty voice,
faintly interested.</p>

<p>“Dead—no, dang ’im!” answered the Sullen Voice,
and a foot spurned him savagely. “Dead—not ’im!
Though ’e ought to be, aye an’ would be, if I ’ad my
way.”</p>

<p>“Easy, mate, easy!” admonished the Hearty Voice.</p>

<p>“Hold y’r tongue, you do!” cried the Querulous
Voice. “Hold your tongue for a bloody-minded
rogue or——”</p>

<p>“Avast, shipmates!” quoth the Hearty Voice.
“Throat-slittin’ be a ticklish business.”</p>

<p>“Yah—dead men doan’t talk!”</p>

<p>“Mebbe not, mate, but live-un’s do! An’ then there
be ghosts, shipmate, ghosts, d’ye see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span></p>

<p>“When can ye take him aboard?” demanded the
Querulous Voice.</p>

<p>“Why, the tide wun’t sarve for ’arf an hour yet.
Plenty time to finish my pipe.... An’ talkin’ o’
ghosts, there was my mate Jerry Banks as was knifed
aboard the <i>Belle Fortun’</i> ... pore Jerry’s ghost used
to come an’ sit o’ nights perched aloft on our main-yard
an’ mew like a cat! Aye, mew ’e would, an’
carry on that mournful ’twas ’orrible, mates——”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue!” cried the Querulous Voice.</p>

<p>“Aye, we doan’t want none o’ your ghosts, do us,
lads?” quoth the Sullen Voice; whereupon was a
mutter of hearty assent.</p>

<p>“Why, very well,” answered he of the hearty voice,
spitting, “only if you’d a-heered the ghost o’ pore
Jerry ... used to mew like any cat, it did, only more
dismal-like.... I never ’eered nothing in all my days
so shiversome and——” The Hearty Voice ended in a
hiss of breath suddenly in-drawn and thereafter was
utter silence, a strange, unnatural stillness wherein
it seemed that none moved or breathed; and then
rose a hoarse, stammering whisper:</p>

<p>“Lord ... O Lord a’ mercy! What’s yon?”</p>

<p>Turning heavy head, Sir John saw about him a
huddle of crouching men who all peered in the one
direction, heard an incoherent, passionate muttering
that changed to a groan, a gasping cry, and a man rose
to his knees with rigid arms out-thrust, staggered to his
feet and leapt down the grassy steep; hereupon the
others awoke to sudden action; ensued a desperate
scrambling, a wild babblement, a thudding of desperate
feet, and Sir John lay staring on the empty dark alone
save for the horse that cropped the grass near by.
And then he too saw a vague and awful shape outlined
in pale fire that flitted unheard upon the gloom and
vanished, only to reappear as suddenly, gliding back
up the slope to where he lay. And watching the thing
approach, Sir John felt his flesh creep and he shivered
with a growing dread that mocked at sanity and reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
until he strove desperately against his bonds, but,
finding this vain, lay still again, watching. On it came,
looming more gigantic and frightful with every yard,
nearer still, until he could distinguish the monstrous
head surmounted by widespreading, fiery horns, nearer,
until from this awful shape a whispering voice reached
him.</p>

<p>“Be that Sir John Dering? Be ye there, sir?”
Then the dreadful thing swayed, stooped upon itself,
thudded to earth, and in its place was a tall, broad-shouldered
man who, running forward, knelt and
began to cut and loose off Sir John’s galling bonds.
“Gagged ye too, ’ave they!” quoth the voice, and next
moment Sir John, relieved of the gag, reached out
fumbling hand and spoke:</p>

<p>“Mr. Potter—O George Potter, though you come
like a demon o’ darkness, a very devil, yet no angel
could be more welcome!”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, Potter frit’ they rogues praper, I rackon.
They cut off amazin’ quick, an’ they ain’t like to come
back—an’ yet they may. So up wi’ ye, sir, an’ quick’s
the word!” Sir John arose but, clapping hand to
head, reeled weakly. “Be your ’ead ’urted bad, sir?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to mention, thanks to my hat and wig.”</p>

<p>“Can ye ride, sir?”</p>

<p>“Easier than walk.”</p>

<p>“Well, up it is, then!” And, half lifting Sir John
to the saddle, Mr. Potter laid a shapeless bundle across
the withers and they set off together.</p>

<p>“How came you so fortunately to my relief,
George?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I happed to be a-waitin’ for Mus’ Sturton
an’ ... t’other ’un, meanin’ to frutten Sturton away
an’ get t’other ’un alone if so might be, when ’long
comes ’alf a dozen chaps wi’ this ’ere ’orse an’ you
acrost it, though I didn’t know ’twas you then, sir.
But suddent-like, t’other ’un says, ‘Why not finish
’im and ha’ done?’ ’e says. ‘Because I wun’t ’ave
it!’ says Sturton, very determinated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span></p>

<p>“’T’other ’un’ being the man Jonas Skag, I think?”
inquired Sir John.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, I wun’t deny it. Well, sir, they stops
purty nigh wheer I wur a-hidin’ to arg’ the matter, an’
I soon found ’twas you they was a-quarrellin’ over. An’
presently on they goes an’ me creepin’ arter ’em bidin’
a chance to do what I might.”</p>

<p>“By means of your horns and bullock’s hide,
George?”</p>

<p>“Aye, this ’ere!” answered Mr. Potter, laying his
hand upon the shapeless bundle. “A good friend it’s
been to pore Potter, sir. Ghosts be useful things
hereabouts.”</p>

<p>“So I have observed!” smiled Sir John. “And,
indeed, you were a terribly convincing ghost.”</p>

<p>“Naun so bad, sir,” admitted Mr. Potter modestly.
“I done my best off an’ on. Though I don’t like
hauntin’ in the open—gimme a wall! Ye see, some
folks be apt to shoot ... there be four or five
bullet-’oles in this ’ere ghost arlready!”</p>

<p>Talking thus, they at last reached the highroad,
and Sir John saw the lights of Alfriston twinkling
before them. Here the discreet Mr. Potter stopped
and, lifting finger to eyebrow, bade Sir John good-night.</p>

<p>“You’ll be arl right now, I rackon, sir,” said he.</p>

<p>But Sir John reached down to grasp his hand.</p>

<p>“You know who I am, I think?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“Aye, Sir John, you be Dering o’ Dering.”</p>

<p>“And a magistrate besides, George Potter, a justice
o’ the Peace and Quorum.”</p>

<p>“And I be Potter the smuggler, sir.”</p>

<p>“And a man, George! And ’tis as such that I shall
always know you, so—give me your hand, friend
George!”</p>

<p>So, in the gloom, hand met and grasped hand.</p>

<p>“Lord, sir,” quoth Mr. Potter, “I dunno as I
bean’t a bit ... glad-loike, you callin’ Potter your
friend an’ arl——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span></p>

<p>“Why then, George, pray tell me why do you seek
Jonas Skag so earnestly?”</p>

<p>“Well, from what I be hearin’ ... an’ likewise
addin’ two an’ two, I rackon Jonas knows more’n
a bit about that theer false signallin’ ... an’ if so
be I find ’e do ... why then, sir—why then——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“No matter, sir—mum for that. But I rackon ’e
wun’t nowise betray no lads to theer deaths never no
more!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, George?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ ’t arl, sir.... Only, talkin’ o’ ghosts,
rackon I made a pretty tidy ’un, but the fire were old
Pen’s idee, though she calls it phross-phross.” So
saying, Mr. Potter shouldered his bundle and trundled
off in the gloom of the hedge, leaving Sir John to ride
thoughtfully into Alfriston.</p>

<span class="smaller">WHICH, AS THE READER OBSERVES, BEGINS AND ENDS WITH MY LORD SAYLE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>My Lord Sayle tugged at the bell-rope and thereafter
stared out into the sunny garden again
as he had done for so long; and presently, the door
opening softly, a man-servant entered who, beholding
thus suddenly my lord’s intent face, checked, shrank
back, and stood, the door in his hand, gazing with eyes
of fearful wonder. At last, becoming aware of the
servant’s presence, my lord spoke, but preserving
always his rapt expression:</p>

<p>“Is Major Orme in the house?”</p>

<p>“No, my lord ... the Major left ... early this
morning, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sir Roland Lingley?”</p>

<p>“My lord, he ... went with the Major.”</p>

<p>My Lord Sayle’s black brows twitched slightly, but
he never moved, staring always out upon the sunny
garden like one who saw that which no other eyes
might behold.</p>

<p>“They left no message?”</p>

<p>“None, my lord,” answered the man-servant,
drawing a soft pace backward as he watched that
rigid face.</p>

<p>“Send Sturton to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p>“And hark’ee! If I should ring again, see that Tom
and Roger answer—themselves only!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord!” murmured the servant, shrinking
again as with a last stealthy glance he went softly
forth, closing the door gently behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span></p>

<p>So Orme and Lingley had gone! Even they had
deserted him at last! Well, so much the better ...
considering. But the smile that distorted my lord’s
mouth was evil to see.</p>

<p>And after some while the door opened and Mr.
Sturton appeared, who, at sign from my lord, entered
and closed the door.</p>

<p>“So—o—o!” said his lordship, dwelling upon the
word while he stared into the haggard face before him.
“You have failed—again, Sturton?”</p>

<p>“’Twas no fault o’ mine, my lord; in another
ten minutes we should ha’ had him safe aboard
ship——”</p>

<p>“Ship?” The word was almost a whisper, and
yet James Sturton recoiled and his face seemed even
more livid as he met the speaker’s glance. “Fool!”
continued my lord in the same dreadful, hushed voice.
“Fool, in the corner yonder you will find a sheet o’
crumpled paper ... open and read it ... read it—aloud!”</p>

<p>Looking whither my lord pointed, Mr. Sturton took
up and smoothed the crumpled sheet, glanced at it
and hesitated.</p>

<p>“Aloud, my lord?”</p>

<p>“Aloud, fool!”</p>

<p>Then, mumbling somewhat, Mr. Sturton read as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sir John Dering begs to say that unless my
Lord Sayle is out of the country within forty-eight
hours, Sir John proposes calling upon
my Lord Sayle with the stoutest horse-whip
to be found.”</p>

</div>

<p>“And you said ‘ship,’ I think?” inquired my lord
in the same strangled voice.</p>

<p>“My lord, once aboard that ship he would trouble
your lordship never again.”</p>

<p>“‘Trouble me never again!’” murmured Lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
Sayle. “He never will ... he never shall ... but
a ship? No, no!... A ship? Pshaw! We know
a better way and a surer—eh, Sturton?”</p>

<p>“Your—your lordship means?”</p>

<p>“Exactly what you are thinking, Sturton!” As
he spoke, my lord crossed to a cabinet and, opening a
drawer, came back with a brace of pistols in his hands.
Now, glancing from these murderous things to the face
above, James Sturton flung out wild hands and started
back.</p>

<p>“No, no!” he cried. “Not this way, my lord; I
cannot!”</p>

<p>“You will!” nodded my lord gently. “You know
very well he walks or rides frequently to High Dering
of an evening—alone! It will be simple.”</p>

<p>“My lord, I ... I cannot!”</p>

<p>“Meaning you will not?”</p>

<p>James Sturton stared desperately about him at
floor and ceiling and walls, but never once at the
speaker’s face; finally he spoke:</p>

<p>“I ... I cannot, my lord.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said his lordship, and stood regarding
Sturton with an expression of mild curiosity. “So you—refuse?”</p>

<p>“I do, my lord!” mumbled the wretched man.</p>

<p>“Knowing that I can hang you for the murderer
you already are? Still, you—refuse?”</p>

<p>“My lord, I do.... I must.... I—I cannot do
it!”</p>

<p>His lordship slowly and deliberately returned the
weapons to the drawer, locked it, and stood awhile
staring at the key in his hand.</p>

<p>“Why, then,” said he at last, still intent upon the
key, “perhaps you will be good enough to pull the
bell.” Mr. Sturton obeyed, but, chancing to catch a
glimpse of my lord’s face in the mirror, he glanced
apprehensively towards the door with the wild glare
of one who suddenly finds himself in a trap; but even
as he stared at it, the door opened and two men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
entered. For a moment was silence; then, without
troubling to turn, my lord spoke:</p>

<p>“You will take this white-livered cur ... strip him
and—drive him out! Strip him—you understand!”
Ensued riot and confusion; but, despite his cries
and desperate struggles, James Sturton was seized
and dragged away at last; then my Lord Sayle,
chin on breast, stared out into the sunny garden
again.</p>

<p>Slowly the glory faded and the shadows deepened
as evening approached, but surely never was there
shadow so dark, so ominous, so evil to behold as that
upon the face of my Lord Sayle. Now if, by some coincidence,
he had chanced to be regarding the noble constellation
of Orion, as was Corporal Robert Doubleday,
surely no two pairs of eyes ever gazed upon Orion’s
glittering belt with expression so vastly different!
For this evening the Corporal’s eyes held a light all
their own, his lean, brown face wore an expression of
extraordinary gentleness, and as he strode blithely
across fragrant meadow he even essayed to sing; to
be sure, his voice was somewhat husky, and creaked a
little uncertainly as by lack of use, but he sang perseveringly,
none the less, an old marching song he had
sung often in Flanders years ago, set to the tune of
“Lilliburlero.”</p>

<p>But, all at once, in the very middle of a note, he
checked voice and foot together as forth from a hedge
before him protruded a head and a pair of stalwart
shoulders clad in an old frieze coat.</p>

<p>“Ha! Is that you, George Potter?”</p>

<p>“My own self, Mus’ Robert. Might you ha’ chanced
to see a man ... or, say, two ... hereabouts, as
you come along?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul!”</p>

<p>“Ah! An’ wheer might Sir John Dering be now,
Mus’ Robert, d’ye s’pose?”</p>

<p>“I left him at ‘The Cross,’ but he usually walks
abroad of an evening.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, so ’e do, Mus’ Robert ... but ... doan’t
’ee let ’im goo out o’ your sight this night.”</p>

<p>“Why not? What d’ye mean, George?”</p>

<p>“Well, rackon it bean’t no-wise ’ealthy-like for Sir
John to goo a-walkin’ to-night alone, ah—an’ p’r’aps
not then.”</p>

<p>“And why? Ah ... d’ye think——”</p>

<p>“Aye, I do think!” nodded Mr. Potter. “I think
as mebbe Murder’ll be a-walkin’ to-night.”</p>

<p>“Murder?” repeated the Corporal, falling back a
step. “Murder? What d’ye mean, man? Speak plain.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, I means plain murder.”</p>

<p>“Who d’ye mean, George?”</p>

<p>“Well, there be them as wishes others dead, d’ye
see—but mum! Only I should keep ’im safe indoors
to-night if I was you.”</p>

<p>“By God, d’ye say so, George?” cried the Corporal;
and staying for no more, he set off at a run; and now,
as he hasted thus, his feet seemed to beat out the
awful word: mur-der, mur-der, and his thoughts were
full of it.</p>

<p>Murder, indeed! But who shall plumb all the
sullen deeps of a murderer’s soul? Who comprehend
the motives that speed him on? What ears but his
may catch those demon voices that have eternally
wooed and urged, argued and threatened, ceaselessly
day and night, until he sees nothing, hears nothing,
is conscious of nothing but the one purpose so gradually
decided upon and, at last, so passionately desired.
What normal intelligence may comprehend the mind
of a murderer?</p>

<p>Watch him as he creeps forth upon his awful business,
a dreadful, furtive creature seeking his unsuspecting
victim.... Behold now the generous cock of his hat,
his neat wig, his full-skirted coat of sober hue! Looked
at from behind, he might be mistaken for an itinerant
preacher of Quakerish persuasion, but seen from in
front he can be nothing under heaven but the murderer
he is in his soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span></p>

<p>Thus goes he, his every faculty so intent upon his
ghastly work that he sees nothing, hears nothing of
the Nemesis that dogs him in the shadows, pausing
when he pauses, looking where he looks, going on
again with him step for step, silent, purposeful and so
dreadfully patient.</p>

<p>So come they at last, the Murderer and his Nemesis,
to a leafy grove that all day long has rung with the
joyous carolling of birds, but now, hushed and silent,
is a place of gloom meet for dark and stealthy deeds.
Within this place of shadow Murder creeps, seeking a
place where, unseen, he may destroy, but always unconscious
of the lurking shape of the Nemesis that
flits ever behind him; suddenly he starts and crouches,
to peer along the glimmering road, for upon the silence
is the sound of a man’s light tread coming at slow,
unhurried pace—the footsteps of a man who dreams....
Stay! What other feet are those that come at
such wild speed, nearer and nearer, until they slacken
somewhat and a panting voice speaks:</p>

<p>“Your honour ... I was a-coming ... to meet
ye.”</p>

<p>“And in mighty haste, Bob!”</p>

<p>“Why ... as to that, sir—’tis growing dark——”</p>

<p>“Since when were you afraid o’ the dark,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“Why—it looks like rain, sir.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, ’tis a very fine night.”</p>

<p>“Why, then—let us walk, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I’m minded to be alone.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, I——”</p>

<p>“So go you in, Bob, and order supper.”</p>

<p>“But, your honour, I——”</p>

<p>“Pray leave me, Robert.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir—George Potter ... he warned me
that——”</p>

<p>“That what?”</p>

<p>“That ’twasn’t, as you might say, healthy for you
hereabouts to-night, sir, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span></p>

<p>“The thought charms me, Robert. And now—pray
be gone.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, if you’ll only——”</p>

<p>“Damme! Will ye go?”</p>

<p>A distressful sigh; the sound of heavy feet unwillingly
retreating, feet that hesitate more than once ere
they finally die away. And presently the light tread
comes on again, slow and unhurried as before. Then
Murder, peering from the shadows, crouches low,
raises and steadies right hand....</p>

<p>A ringing shot from the denser gloom, a cry of
amazement lost in strangling groan.... A second
shot, louder, nearer ... a dreadful gasping ... a
horrid thrashing among the underbrush ... silence.
Then Sir John, staring upon that place of horror,
began to creep thither ... was aware that men were
running towards him, shouting to one another,
and, without looking, knew these for Robert and
George Potter, which last bore a small, covered
lanthorn.</p>

<p>So, together, they entered the little grove, and
presently came upon a stilly shape crouched face down
among the underbrush; and beholding the three-cornered
hat of generous cock, the neat wig, the wide-skirted
coat, Mr. Potter whistled softly.</p>

<p>“Rackon Sturton’s got it at last!” quoth he.</p>

<p>“Aye, but—there’s another over here!” cried the
Corporal from the denser shadows. “Aye—another o’
them ... and it looks—it looks like ... bring the
light!”</p>

<p>Coming where stood the Corporal, Mr. Potter bent
down, lanthorn in hand, only to start to his feet again
very suddenly.</p>

<p>“Lord!” he exclaimed in awestruck voice. “Why,
lord, sirs, this ’un be Sturton, sure enough ... aye,
an’ sure enough dead.... Rackon ’e won’t never
want no more.... But who—who lays over
yonder?”</p>

<p>They came back to the first still form and, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
Sir John held the lanthorn, Potter and the Corporal
turned it over and, recoiling, stood mute a while and
motionless; for there, scowling up at them in death
as he had so often done in life, was the dead face of
my Lord Sayle.</p>

<span class="smaller">TELLS HOW SIR JOHN DERING FLED THE DOWN-COUNTRY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The ancient cross was casting its shadow far
athwart the silent street, for it was very early
and the sun but new-risen, therefore the birds were
jubilant, raising a chorus of welcome to the new day;
but Sir John, leaning out from his bedchamber
window, gazed down at the battered old cross very
wistfully and sighed deep and often. To him presently
entered Corporal Robert, bearing a valise.</p>

<p>“You ordered the chaise for half after four, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you ha’ told no one of my proposed departure
... Sir Hector, for instance?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Excellent!” murmured Sir John, and sighed
immediately.</p>

<p>“I mentioned the matter to nobody, sir—except
... Her, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Her?” exclaimed Sir John, starting. “’S death,
man, she is the very last person—hum! Whom d’ye
mean, Bob? What ‘her’?”</p>

<p>“The—one and only, sir ... Ann, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Ha! And d’you tell her—everything?”</p>

<p>“Well—very near, sir.”</p>

<p>“And she still loves ye, Bob ... art sure?”</p>

<p>“I venter so to believe, sir. She—she tells me so,
your honour.”</p>

<p>“A good woman’s abiding love,” sighed Sir John,
“is a very precious thing to a man o’ sentiment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span></p>

<p>“And extreme rare, Bob.” Here Sir John scowled
at the old cross and became bitter all at once. “Aye,
indeed, true love in a woman is as hard to find as flies
in winter or ice in summer, by heaven!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir?” answered Robert the Imperturbable.
“Will you have your blue and silver in the valise
or——”</p>

<p>“Damn my blue and silver!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.... Or shall I pack it in the trunk along
o’——”</p>

<p>“Curse the trunk! Curse everything! I’m talking
o’ love!”</p>

<p>“Very good, your honour.”</p>

<p>“And I say that women’s love is a devilish shy
thing, very apt to take wing and fly away. ’Tis found
but to be lost. ’Tis a slight thing and very transient.
Pluck it and it withers, grasp it and it crumbles to
sorry dust, taste it and ’tis ashes in the mouth. ’Tis
a bitter-sweet, an emptiness, a merest bagatelle, an
apple o’ Sodom!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir? And will you wear your light
walking-sword with the silver——”</p>

<p>“Burn ye, Bob, are ye attending? I said an apple
o’ Sodom!”</p>

<p>“Why, your honour, it don’t sound a very tasty
fruit.”</p>

<p>Sir John’s gloomy features were lightened by a
passing smile.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” he sighed, “Venus be kind to thee,
Bob!... And to-day you begin your new duties.
You will look to the comfort and welfare of the
tenantry?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, sir.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I’m sure you will.”</p>

<p>“Though your honour will be sorely missed....
And the old House o’ Dering ... all done up like
noo, such paintin’ and gildin’ ... and now to go
empty still! Aye, High Dering will surely miss your
honour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span></p>

<p>“Never i’ the world, Bob!”</p>

<p>“And Sir Hector will likewise miss ye, sir.”</p>

<p>“Aye, he may.”</p>

<p>“And I shall miss your honour.”</p>

<p>“For a little while, mayhap.”</p>

<p>“Always and ever, sir!”</p>

<p>“You will have a young and pretty wife soon,
Bob.”</p>

<p>“Aye ... and she will miss ye too, sir—we shall
both miss ye.... And there’s—others, sir——”</p>

<p>“Who, pray?”</p>

<p>“Your lady, sir.”</p>

<p>“I ha’ no lady.”</p>

<p>“I mean Mrs. Rose——”</p>

<p>“There is no such creature!”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, my Lady Barrasdaile, your honour, she
will be——”</p>

<p>“Enough!” said Sir John in his haughtiest tone,
and regarding the Corporal with his iciest air of fine-gentlemanly
aloofness. “You may leave me,
Robert!”</p>

<p>“But I’ve your honour’s valise to pack, sir,
and——”</p>

<p>“Then you may pack it elsewhere ... pray, leave
me!”</p>

<p>The Corporal glanced furtively askance, and, noting
the droop of Sir John’s eyelids, the tilt of his chin,
gathered up clothes and valise and, shaking gloomy
head, departed forthwith.</p>

<p>Left alone, Sir John leaned pensively from the open
casement again, to survey the deserted, winding street
with its narrow pavements, its tiled roofs, its neat
rows of houses, and the battered shaft of its age-worn
cross rising stark against the sun’s level beams, for it
was in his mind that he might never behold this scene
again, and he sighed more deeply than ever; then
leaned suddenly to peer down the street, for upon the
air was a sound of approaching feet that woke the
echoes—heavy feet that strode masterfully; and thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
he presently espied Sir Hector, his wig askew, his
weatherbeaten hat cocked at combative angle, purpose
in every line of his gigantic figure.</p>

<p>Sir John frowned, pished and psha-ed, and, turning
from the window, summoned Corporal Robert.</p>

<p>“You tell me that Sir Hector is unaware of my
early departure?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“So far as I know, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then what doth he abroad at so unseasonable an
hour, pray?”</p>

<p>“Abroad, your honour? Where, sir?”</p>

<p>“Coming up the street—demme! There he is!”
exclaimed Sir John pettishly, as a loud whistle shrilled
beneath the window.</p>

<p>“Aye, that will be Sir Hector, your honour.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll not see him! Confound everything, I
say, I’ll not be pestered, Bob!”</p>

<p>“Oho, John ... Johnnie ... ocheigh!”</p>

<p>Sir John promptly closed the window, whereupon
Sir Hector’s voice rose but the louder:</p>

<p>“Oho, John ... wull ye no loot me ben?”</p>

<p>“Damme, but he’ll rouse the village!” cried Sir
John.</p>

<p>“Shall I go down and let him in, your honour?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, in the devil’s name! And hurry, he’ll
be roaring in a moment.”</p>

<p>Downstairs hasted Corporal Robert and opened the
door, thus checking Sir Hector in the very commencement
of an eldritch Highland war-cry, who nodded
grimly and mounted the stair forthwith.</p>

<p>“Weel, Johnnie,” quoth he, “sae ye’re gangin’,
lad, awa’ frae your friends——”</p>

<p>“In about twenty minutes, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Aye! An’ whyfor maun ye steal awa’ wi’ no sae
muckle as a grup o’ the hand?”</p>

<p>“I intended to write to you, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Aye! An’ what o’ the leddies ... especially
one?”</p>

<p>“I trust they are blooming in all health.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span></p>

<p>“Aye! An’ whyfor maun ye rin awa’? Why
maun we twine?”</p>

<p>“Because, since my Lord Sayle hath ceased to be, I
languish for an object, Hector. The country wearies
me.”</p>

<p>“Aye! An’ whaur are ye intendin’ for?”</p>

<p>“London or Paris, perchance both.”</p>

<p>“Ou aye! An’ whiles ye’re gallivantin’ yonder,
what o’ the puir, sweet lass wha’s breakin’ her
heart for ye? What o’ Rose—no, the Leddy
Herminia?”</p>

<p>“I venture to think her heart, if she hath one, is
as sound as ever——”</p>

<p>“Ha! O man, I whiles wonder at ye!”</p>

<p>“Faith, Hector, the heart o’ your finished coquette
is a tough morsel——”</p>

<p>“And—ye loved her once, John!”</p>

<p>“I admit the folly, Hector. But my lady, happily
for me, very deliberately and effectively killed that
very preposterously foolish passion.”</p>

<p>“She slaughtered it unco’ quick, John, I’m
thinkin’!”</p>

<p>“Yet none the less effectually, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Ah, John lad, but true love taketh a deal o’ killing,
and moreover——”</p>

<p>“Gad’s life!” laughed Sir John. “What know you
o’ love?”</p>

<p>Sir Hector quailed somewhat, dropped his hat and
grew uncommonly red in the face, picking it up.</p>

<p>“Why, since you ask,” he answered, “I—I’ve read
some such in a book.... But, talkin’ o’ Rose—Herminia——”</p>

<p>“Is so much waste o’ time and breath, Hector.”</p>

<p>“John ... O Johnnie, dae ye mean that?”</p>

<p>“Extremely!”</p>

<p>“You hae no desire to see her, or hear——”</p>

<p>“Positively no!”</p>

<p>“Then ye’re a heartless gomeril!”</p>

<p>“Venus be thanked!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span></p>

<p>“Man, are ye gone gyte? John, this is no’ like ye.
’Tis unworthy! This smacks o’ pride an’ fulish
pique!” Sir John flushed angrily and opened the
lattice.</p>

<p>“Enough, Hector!” said he, glancing out into the
street. “Let us converse of other things—my chaise
should be here soon.”</p>

<p>“John,” continued Sir Hector in his most precise
English, “thou’rt throwing away a great love, such a
love as cometh to bless but few poor mortals, and then
but once, for true love, John, being lightly scorned,
cometh not again ... forbye, I read this in a book
also!... But, O lad, ’tis in my mind you shall come
to rue this bitterly—aye, to your last hour.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, pray heaven I live not overlong!”</p>

<p>Sir Hector stared into the coldly smiling face before
him much as it had been the face of a stranger.</p>

<p>“Why, then, I’m by with ye, John!” sighed he.
“Only this, either you are utterly heartless and selfish
or....”</p>

<p>“Or, Hector?”</p>

<p>“Or agonising for her in your heart!”</p>

<p>“And yonder,” said Sir John, glancing from the
window—“yonder is the chaise at last, I think.”</p>

<p>The vehicle in question having drawn up before the
inn, Sir John put on hat and cloak and they descended
the stair, all three, and with never a word between
them.</p>

<p>“The valises, Robert?”</p>

<p>“Here, your honour!”</p>

<p>“The trunk, Robert?”</p>

<p>“Aye, sir!” And, beckoning to the post-boy,
Robert hurried back upstairs, leaving Sir John to
glance at the chaise, the horses, the blue sky and the
deserted street, while Sir Hector stared gloomily at
his own shabby hat, turning it over and over as if it
had been some rare and very curious object.</p>

<p>“’Tis to Parus ye’ll be gangin’, John?”</p>

<p>“Very like, Hector.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span></p>

<p>“An’ the de’il! Aye, ’tis the muckle de’il ye’re
bound for, lad!”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Troth, an’ indeed Auld Hornie’ll hae ye in his
cloofs for guid and a’ this time. Oh, ’tis waefu’ an’
a’ by reason o’ your stubborn, wilfu’ pride!... An’
here was Auld Hector dreamin’ o’ ye settlin’ doon at
last wi’ a bonny wife ... aye, an’ bairns, mebbe!...
I was thinkin’ if ... your first chanced to be
a boy ... mebbe you’d name him after me. Hector’s
no sic a bad name, Johnnie ... but now....”</p>

<p>“Now, Hector, seeing I have not the remotest
thought of marrying, why not get wed yourself ...
Mrs. Saunders, say ... and call your first son ‘John’
after me?”</p>

<p>“Whisht, lad, dinna lichtlie the matter! Do not
mock, sir!”</p>

<p>“I speak in all seriousness, Hector.”</p>

<p>“Do not make me a jest, sir! Do not sneer at an
old man’s dreams.... They were very dear, very
sacred to me. And now they lie shattered by your
detestable selfishness ... and I am an old man
indeed!”</p>

<p>“Though you never looked stronger, Hector!”</p>

<p>“And what o’ your tenantry, your people that
should be your responsibility?”</p>

<p>“I leave them in good and, I think, capable hands.”</p>

<p>“And Dering Manor, John ... the old house
you’ve just had made habitable, will you leave it to
emptiness and decay?”</p>

<p>Sir John turned to stare down the empty street.</p>

<p>“Go you and live there, Hector,” said he at last.
“Why not? Mayhap I shall come back one day, but
... just now I—I could not bear the place.... And,
thank heaven, here they come with the trunk!” So
saying, Sir John stepped rather hastily into the chaise
as Robert and the post-boy appeared, bearing the
leathern trunk between them.</p>

<p>“All aboard, Bob?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span></p>

<p>“Aye, your honour.”</p>

<p>“You will write every week regarding the estates?”</p>

<p>“Every week, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then good-bye, Bob!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, your honour!” And, having shaken
the hand Sir John extended, the Corporal took three
steps to the rear and stood at attention.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Fare ye weel, John! An’ ... ye’ve nae worrd
for her ... no message? Juist ane worrd, John?”</p>

<p>“Not one, Hector!”</p>

<p>“Aweel, guid-bye, lad! An’ when ye’re weary an’
waeful an’ heartsick, come back tae Alfriston, to the
Downs, tae auld Hector as lo’es ye vera weel—guid-bye!”
Then Sir Hector nodded, the post-boy cracked
his whip and the chaise rolled away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII<br />
<span class="smaller">TELLETH HOW MY LADY HERMINIA BARRASDAILE WENT A-WOOING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It was a golden morning; beyond dew-spangled
hedgerows stretched green meadows where
brooks sparkled and the river gleamed, while afar,
to right and left, rose the majestic shapes of Windover
and Firle Beacon.</p>

<p>Never had the country looked so fair, never had it
filled him with such yearning; never had the birds
carolled so joyously. And very soon, instead of this
widespread smiling countryside he loved so much, the
reverent hush and stillness of these everlasting hills,
the rugged, simple folk he had learned to honour and
respect, in place of all this would be the narrow, roaring
streets of London, the glitter of Mayfair, the whirl of
Paris.... Emptiness and Desolation! Sir John
sighed again and closed his eyes wearily.</p>

<p>Presently from an inner pocket he took a wallet,
whence he extracted a small, folded paper and, opening
this, beheld a thick curl of glossy black hair; for a
long moment he gazed down at this; then, taking it
from the paper, made to toss it from the chaise window.
But, as he did so, the pretty thing twined itself softly
about his finger and clung there, whereupon he sighed,
raised it suddenly to his lips, kissed it passionately and
cast it forth, shaking it violently from his hand much
as if it had stung him.</p>

<p>And now from the wallet he drew a folded parchment,
and frowned at the words that stared at him therefrom
in fair black and white:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A special Licence of Marriage, between....</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span></p>

<p>Beholding which words, he laughed bitterly and
made to tear the thing, then paused, folded and replaced
it in the wallet, and thrusting this back into
his pocket, sat in frowning reverie.</p>

<p>Thus drove Sir John through the golden morning,
looking neither to right nor left, scowling at the cushions
before him, at his buckled shoes, his silk stockings,
at anything and anywhere rather than the countryside
he was leaving.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was about to order the post-boy to
drive faster, when the chaise slowed up suddenly and
jolted to a standstill.</p>

<p>Out of the window went Sir John’s indignant head
on the instant.</p>

<p>“What the devil are ye stopping for?” he demanded.
“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I dunno, sir,” answered the post-boy, pointing
with his whip, “but ’twas all along o’ ’er ... in the
middle o’ the road, sir!”</p>

<p>Forth from the chaise leapt Sir John in a fury.</p>

<p>“Damme, are ye drunk?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Nary a drop, your honour, since nine o’clock las’
night, on my David, sir! But theer she was, your
honour, in the middle o’ the fair-way, d’ye see, a-wavin’
of ’er arms wild-like ... wouldn’t move, an’ us nigh
a-top of ’er, so pull up I ’ad to, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” quoth Sir John. “And now, my good
Addlepate, will you pray inform me what the devil
you are stopping for?”</p>

<p>“Why, lord, sir, ain’t I a-tellin’ your honour as
she came out o’ the ’edge yonder all suddent-like, an’
waved ’er arms wild-like an’——”</p>

<p>“Aye, my good numbskull, but who?”</p>

<p>“A ’ooman, sir, a precious big ’un in a——”</p>

<p>“Then where is she, my good clod, where is she?”</p>

<p>“Here!” answered a voice.</p>

<p>Sir John spun round upon his heel and very nearly
gaped.</p>

<p>She was sitting in the chaise, her eyes very bright,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
her cheeks a little flushed beneath the hood of the
long grey cloak that enfolded her.</p>

<p>For a long moment they gazed at one another
speechlessly, while the post-boy sucked at the knob
of his whip and stared with eyes round and bright as
his buttons, for whose behoof Sir John presently
spoke.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said he, bowing with extreme ceremony,
“I trust we ha’n’t kept your ladyship long a-waiting!...
You may drive on, my addle-brained wiseacre,
and pocket this guinea for possessing the wit not to
run over a lady in broad daylight.” So saying, Sir
John bestowed the coin, got into the chaise and closed
the door, whereupon the jubilant post-boy cracked his
whip ecstatically, chirruped gaily to his horses, and
they drove on again.</p>

<p>“And now, madame,” inquired Sir John coldly,
eyelids a-droop, chin uptilted, and seated as far from
her as the narrow vehicle allowed, “pray, what folly
is this?”</p>

<p>“Folly, indeed, John, to run away ... and so
very early in the morning, too!”</p>

<p>“How came you hither, madame?”</p>

<p>“In George Potter’s cart.... And do not be so
extreme distant, John ... for thee I left my warm
bed at sunrise!”</p>

<p>“Your ladyship amazes me!”</p>

<p>“Merely because, sir, with all your knowledge of
womankind, you don’t in the very least apprehend this
woman.... O John, didst think I would suffer thee
to steal thyself from me, so?”</p>

<p>“And why are you here, madame?”</p>

<p>“To woo thee,” she answered softly, “to seek thy
love.”</p>

<p>Sir John started and turned to glance out of the
window.</p>

<p>“How—how did you learn that I was leaving?”
he questioned hastily.</p>

<p>“Old Penelope told me ... and, John dear, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
gave me a charm; a very potent spell should prevail
with thee, an’ my poor pleading may not.”</p>

<p>Now, hearing the soft yearning in her voice, conscious
of all the new, sweet gentleness of her as, tremulous,
wistful, she leaned towards him appealingly, he looked
resolutely out of the window.</p>

<p>“Spells and charms the most potent, my lady,
shall prove of none avail, for my love is surely
dead!”</p>

<p>“Nay, thou foolish John, perchance it may swoon a
little, but ’tis not dead, for love that is of the true
sort may never die. And thy love, methinks, is a true
love indeed.”</p>

<p>“It was,” he corrected; “and you made of it a
mock——”</p>

<p>“Nay, I did but laugh, John, but not at thy dear
love-making.... Oh, indeed, thou’rt the merest man
to be so blind! My laughter was by reason o’ the
broken ornament, the tumbled chair, my torn gown....
I must ha’ seemed so clumsy ... but the room
was so strait and I always feel myself so hugely vast!
My laughter, John, was merest hysteria, which was
strange in me, for I was never so before.”</p>

<p>“Ha—never?” he questioned suddenly.</p>

<p>“Never with thee, John.”</p>

<p>“The night Death crawled upon me in the
hedge?”</p>

<p>“And I shielded thy dear body with mine, John
... because I feared for thee, loved thee, and would
ha’ died for thee.... And ’twas because of the last
five years, the evil I had spoken of thee, the harms I
had wickedly tried to work thee ... this was why
I would have died for thee, John, this, but never
hysteria.... Aye, I know, indeed, I so named it,
but this was only because I could think of naught else
to retort upon thee with....”</p>

<p>“Couldst indeed be so cruel?” he questioned more
gently, but with his gaze still averted.</p>

<p>“Yet am I kinder than thou,” she answered, “for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
if thou wilt break my poor heart and ruin my life,
I will not suffer thee to break thine own.... So am
I here beseeching thee to come back to love and me
and the dear Down-country.”</p>

<p>“Nay, this cannot be.”</p>

<p>“Because I do love thee truly, John.”</p>

<p>“This I cannot believe.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, John, I am here to follow thee where
thou wilt, to beseech thy forgiveness, to supplicate
thee to love me a little ... and because I am thine
own, now and always, thou dear, brave, kind, cruel,
unbelieving, wise and most foolish John! Wilt
not look at me even now? Then needs must I use
old Penelope’s charm!”</p>

<p>Speaking thus, she thrust something into his fingers,
and he saw this for the miniature of his long-dead
father.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed. “What o’ this?”</p>

<p>“You must open it, John. Penelope bid me tell
you to open the back and read what your father
wrote there so many years agone.”</p>

<p>Mutely he obeyed, and, inscribed in small, clear
characters, saw this:</p>

<p class="center">Beloved,<br />
though death<br />
must needs come<br />
to us soon or late,<br />
yet do I know we can<br />
never die since Love<br />
is immortal. So by<br />
thy love shall I live<br />
on beyond death<br />
with thee for<br />
ever. Thy<br />
John Dering.</p>

<p>For a while he sat staring at this message from the
“living” dead; at last, and suddenly, he turned and
looked at her.</p>

<p>“John,” she whispered, “take me, beloved, and so
let us make each other immortal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span></p>

<p>Then Sir John reached out his arms and, drawing her
to him, gazed deep into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Herminia,” said he, “O Rose o’ love ... my Rose
in very truth, at last!”</p>

<p>“For thy wearing, John,” she sighed, “or needs
must I fade soon and wither utterly away.”</p>

<span class="smaller">WHICH IS, HAPPILY, THE LAST</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Old Mr. Dumbrell, perched in George Potter’s
cart behind the likely horse, blinked at the
setting sun and shook his head; quoth he:</p>

<p>“The longer oi live, Jarge, the more sartin-sure
be oi that there be no sich thing as gratitood nowheres,
no!”</p>

<p>“What be troublin’ of ’ee now, Gaffer?”</p>

<p>“Thinkin’ o’ Sir John Dering, oi be. Oh, ’e’s
mebbe this an’ that an’ t’other, but oi calls ’im
naun but a ongrateful young barrynet!”</p>

<p>“Lord, old ’un,” remonstrated Mr. Potter, “ain’t
’e given ye your cottage, rent free?”</p>

<p>“Wot o’ that?” snarled the Aged Soul. “Ain’t ’e
got ’unnerds an’ thousands o’ cottages? Wot’s a
cottage?”</p>

<p>“Well, but ain’t ’e likewise give ye that little
medder be’ind your cottage?”</p>

<p>“Oi never said ’e ’adn’t, did oi?”</p>

<p>“Aye, but ain’t ’e give ye a cow along o’ the medder
an’ a couple o’ fat ’ogs?”</p>

<p>“Wot of ’em?” screeched the Aged One indignantly.
“Oi bean’t complainin’ o’ they, be oi? No,
my trouble be ’im a-goin’ away an’ never s’ much as
a word to oi ... an’ me sech a very old, aged Soul
as can’t live much longer, an’ ’im a-leavin’ pore old
oi wi’ never no good-bye ... an’ never sendin’ me
that theer arm-cheer as ’e promised faithful!”</p>

<p>“Arm-cheer?” repeated Mr. Potter inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Ah! ’Osea,’ says ’e, aye, an’ called me ’is friend,
’e did, ’Osea,’ says ’e, ‘you shall set in comfort arl<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
your days,’ ’e sez—them were ’is very words! An’
I’ve been ’opin’ an’ a-waitin’ an’ expectin’ that theer
cheer ever since.... An’ look wot I done for ’e!”</p>

<p>“Wot?” demanded Mr. Potter.</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t oi comfort ’e an’ talk to ’e when arl
the world was agin’ him? Didn’t oi speak up for ’e
on arl ’casions, ah—an’ mak’ love for ’e to ’is sweet-’eart,
tu? Wasn’t oi loike a feäther an’ mother arl
rolled into one? An’ now ’ere be oi, an’ ’im gone—an’
no cheer!”</p>

<p>It was at this moment that, turning into the main
road, they beheld a dusty chaise approaching at a
smart trot, whereupon, the way being somewhat
narrow, Mr. Potter pulled aside to make room; but
scarcely had he done so than a cheery voice hailed
him, the chaise pulled up, and out from the window
came a bewigged head.</p>

<p>“Why, Potter—George Potter,” cried a merry
voice. “God bless ye, George; ’tis very well met!
And my friend Hosea too! How art thou, my
Aged Soul? I vow thou’rt looking younger than
ever!”</p>

<p>“Lord, Sir John!” exclaimed Mr. Potter heartily,
“I be main glad to see ye back, sir.”</p>

<p>“And I’m back for good, George ... aye, for good
of every kind and sort, I hope——”</p>

<p>“Why, then, that theer cheer, Sir John!” piped the
Aged One. “Wot about my arm-cheer?”</p>

<p>“’E means the cheer your honour promised ’im,
sir,” explained Mr. Potter.</p>

<p>“Chair?” repeated Sir John in laughing puzzlement.
“I fear I don’t recall ... but we will talk of
this later. For the present, George, I want you to
drive over to old Penelope and warn her that she
hath visitors on the way to drink tea with her——”</p>

<p>“Say two visitors, Mr. Potter,” laughed a second
voice, and over Sir John’s shoulder peeped my lady’s
lovely face; whereupon Mr. Potter flourished his whip
exultantly and, wheeling the likely horse, drove off at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
such a pace that he was necessitated to hug the small,
protesting Aged Soul for safety’s sake.</p>

<p>“’Twill give our revered witch due time to don the
silken gown, mayhap, my Rose o’ love.”</p>

<p>“Aye, though—I think ’tis donned already, sir.”</p>

<p>“She expects us, then?”</p>

<p>“She doth, John!... And Aunt Lucinda will be
there, and Sir Hector ... unless we have outworn
their patience.”</p>

<p>“But what shall bring them there? How know
you this, child?”</p>

<p>“’Faith, sir, ’tis because I invited ’em to meet us
at Penelope’s cottage——”</p>

<p>“Ha, wert so sure we should come back together,
my Herminia?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, John dear. Though I little
thought we should ha’ kept them so long a-waiting—see,
the sun is set already and—nay, sir ... oh, for
mercy’s sake, John ... you’ll ha’ my hair all
down——”</p>

<p>“You’ll look but the lovelier——”</p>

<p>“Nay, prithee ... oh, hark, John! Dost hear,
dost hear how they welcome thee home at last,
beloved?”</p>

<p>Upon the air rose a sudden, glad riot of bells lustily
rung, a faint, silvery pealing that grew momentarily
louder, until the joyous clamour thrilled in the air all
about them.</p>

<p>“Hark, my John, where they welcome Dering of
Dering home at last!”</p>

<p>“And his most dear lady!” he answered, drawing
her close. “For, O my Herminia, my Rose-child,
thou shalt teach him to live to better purpose ... by
thee ‘The Wicked Dering’ shall——”</p>

<p>“Ah, hush!” she murmured. “He was but a
dream ... but thou, my dear, brave, noble, most
honourable ... oh, wilt stifle me, John? Nay,
they will see us——”</p>

<p>So in due season they drove into the winding street<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
of High Dering where stood folk to cheer, to flourish
hats and flutter scarves a little shyly, but to fall
suddenly silent and stare wide-eyed as Sir John, my
lady beside him, paused bare-headed to salute that
solitary old creature whom all had scorned so long
and persecuted as a witch; silent she stood leaning
upon her staff, but in all the glory of rustling silk and
belaced mutch, her indomitable old head aloft, her
bright, old eyes keen as ever, yet surely strangely
gentle for a witch. And now Sir John was speaking,
his clear voice very plain to be heard:</p>

<p>“Good friend Penelope, the years have been very
cruel and hard for thee. But indeed thy sufferings
have not been wholly in vain, as I think, and henceforth,
John Dering shall be the first to do thee honour.”
So saying, he took that worn and shrivelled hand,
drawing it within his arm, and so brought her to the
cottage gate where stood the Duchess, glad-eyed, with
Sir Hector towering gigantic behind her.</p>

<p>But now Mr. Potter’s voice was heard in placid
exhortation:</p>

<p>“Come, friends and neighbours, cheer now, a cheer
for Dering o’ Dering and his lady!” Hereupon, led
by Mr. Potter’s stentorian voice and the Aged Soul’s
shrill pipe, they cheered full-throated and with a will.
“An’ now, neighbours, one more for old Pen, as be
true Sussex through an’ through, barn an’ bred——”</p>

<p>“Aye, cheer, ye fules!” shrilled the Aged Soul,
flourishing his hat. “Beller for ol’ Pen, an’ dannel
’im as doan’t, says oi!”</p>

<p>“Hoot-toot, Johnnie-man,” quoth Sir Hector as
they crossed the little garden, “ye kept us waitin’
a’ the day whiles ye made up your mind, it seems-an’
me in ma vera best clo’es, y’ ken—but ’twas worth
it, lad, and—why, what now?” For old Penelope
had paused suddenly to take my lady’s hand to gaze
on it through gathering tears and kiss it with strange
fervour.</p>

<p>“What, John—a ring?” exclaimed Sir Hector—“an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
a weddin’-ring, forbye—already? Why, man,
doth it mean——”</p>

<p>“Ah, Sir Hector,” cried old Penelope, “it do mean
as the dead, as liveth for ever, hath spoke from beyond
his grave ... it meaneth, God be praised, that true
love is immortal indeed!” So, hand in hand, the old
woman and the young entered the cottage.</p>

<p>“But, Johnnie, wull ye be for tellin’ me that it
means——?”</p>

<p>“That they are married, sir,” answered the little
Duchess—“wooed and won and wedded, sir! Which
is great joy to me, for our Herminia hath found a man
shall rule her rigorously at last; in a word, master her
megrims, control, curb and constrain her contrariness
as only a masterful man might.”</p>

<p>“Wooed and won ... rule rigorously,” murmured
Sir Hector, “curb and constrain——”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, well, why must you mop and mow
and mutter like a mere male? Wouldst not do the
same, sir?”</p>

<p>Then, looking down into the little Duchess’s strangely
youthful eyes, Sir Hector emitted that sound to which
no one but a true-born Scot may give utterance, and
which, so far as poor words go, may be roughly
translated thus:</p>

<p>“Umph-humph!” quoth Sir Hector Lauchlan
MacLean.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Designs by</i> FRANK BRANGWYN</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ordinary cloth edition, 8¼″ × 5½″. 6s. net.</i></p>

<p>A beautiful and tasteful edition of this great classic. In
Fitzgerald’s translation, it has been beautified at the hands
of that wonderful artist, Frank Brangwyn, A.R.A., in colour
and monochrome. Every verse is in an appropriately
designed border, in a pleasant grey ink, and in addition,
there are four full colour page plates conveying with
astonishing reality the poem’s atmosphere. Mr. Brangwyn
has, too, designed special end-papers. There is a scholarly
introduction by Joseph Jacobs, and the book also contains
a short life of the “Astronomer-Poet of Persia,” and
a few explanatory notes on the poem. The ordinary
edition of the book is bound in strong blue cloth boards,
with design on front cover in gold, but the volume is
also published in six other editions, in sumptuous styles,
in various kinds of leathers and bindings, for presentation
purposes chiefly. Editions are also now published in
various kinds of leather, illustrated by Fred Adlington.</p>

A BRIGHT GIRL CAN DO</p>

<p class="center"><i>by</i> JEAN STEWART</p>

<p class="center"><i>Large Crown 8vo, cloth. 6/- net.</i></p>

<p>How to do—how to make practically everything a girl can
wish, outdoors and indoors, winter and summer! There
is not a girl in this country to-day between six and sixteen
who would not feel tremendously richer and happier for a
copy of this book—it is a liberal education in itself.
Hockey; lawn tennis; croquet; swimming, rowing, sculling,
golf, hopscotch, dancing; camping; gardening; sketching
and painting; stencilling; architecture; keeping pets;
palmistry and fortune-telling; model theatres and plays;
dolls’ houses; binding; raffia work; knitting and netting;
crocheting; sewing; indoor games; sweet and drink
making; how to make countless articles—so the list goes
on almost unendingly, amusement for hand and brain.
There is no better medicine for “grumpiness,” “dumps,”
or that general fed-up and run-down feeling—a dose taken
frequently between meals will keep a girl in good health
and spirits.</p>

A BRIGHT BOY CAN DO</p>

<p class="center"><i>by</i> MANY HANDS</p>

<p class="center"><i>Large Crown 8vo, cloth. 6/- net.</i></p>

<p>It is evident that many hands make light the work—in this
case many hands have succeeded in making bright <i>this</i>
work. The volume—a good, big, strong one of 440 pages—is
uniform in style with <i>Three Hundred and One Things a
Bright Girl Can Do</i>.</p>

<p>The boys have no reason for worrying because the girls have
one more thing to do (a woman’s work is never done, anyway)
for herein they will find treasure in bucketsful. Training;
gymnastics; walking, running and jumping; hockey
and Indian clubs; swimming, rowing and water-polo;
paperchasing, football, golf and boxing; skating; angling;
canoeing and yachting; butterfly and moth collecting;
aquariums; outdoor games; gardening; drawing and
painting; ventriloquism; magic and conjuring; keeping
pets; fireside amusements; experimenting and science;
things a boy can make—all this and more dealt with by
expert authors who know what boys want to do. This book
ought to be called “The Boy’s Golden Treasury of What to
Do—and How to Do It.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>by</i> JACQUES REINDORP</p>

<p class="center"><i>Demy 8vo, cloth. 5/- net.</i></p>

<p>An ideal present for any boy, especially the mechanically-minded
youngster. A few boys from “The Toolhouse
Club” build their clubroom, and proceed to do some really
interesting things: light the clubhouse with electricity,
make a wireless set, phantascope, a telephone, do some wood-carving;
but, best of all, they build a full-size boat from
beginning to end, and finally go on voyages of exploration
up their river.</p>

<p class="center p120">GODS OF MODERN GRUB STREET</p>

<p class="center"><i>by</i></p>

<p class="center">A. ST. JOHN ADCOCK</p>

<p class="center"><i>Thirty-two Portraits by</i> E. O. HOPPÉ</p>

<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo, cloth. 7/6 net.</i></p>

<p>Everyone is curious to know how the heights of Mount
Olympus have been gained, and especially is this interest
aroused in the case of our contemporary novelists, poets
and dramatists. Often they are but a name, a nebulous
entity emerging out of our enjoyment of their works.
Such healthy curiosity is satisfied by this book, which
makes a double appeal, the photographs accompanying the
essays creating an atmosphere of very real intimacy. The
name of the well-known author and critic, Mr. A. St. John
Adcock, on the title page is ample warrant that the essays
are thoroughly critical and informing, but their chief aim
is to complement each portrait with a sketch of the sitter’s
personality, to tell the story of his career and indicate to
what extent the facts of his life have influenced his outlook
and his work:</p>

<p>Mr. E. O. Hoppé is admittedly the most finished artist
among present-day photographers. To sit for him is a
distinction in itself, and we find that in the camera portraits
included in the volume he has given us a series of 32
studies of great charm and distinction. The selection is of
wide range, and perhaps its distinguishing characteristic is
the capacity shown by both author and artist to get under
the skin of each subject.</p>

<p class="center">ALFRED T. SCHOFIELD, M.D., M.R.C.S.E.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo, cloth. 6/- net.</i></p>

<p>A graphic and yet simple description of the Holy Land.
Short of spending a long period there and traversing it
again and again in leisurely fashion, it is doubtful if one
could gain in any other way so thorough an understanding of
the places, manners and customs as by a study of this book.
The Biblical allusions are so well brought out and illustrated
that one begins to think of the various places mentioned with
the same familiarity that we have with places in our own
country. The marked map, following the footsteps of our
Lord, and the forty-three photographic views, add greatly
to the feeling of familiarity.</p>

<p class="center p120">THE STORY OF ST. PAUL’S LIFE
AND LETTERS</p>

<p class="center"><i>by</i></p>

<p class="center">J. PATERSON SMYTH, B.D., Litt.D., LL.D., D.C.L.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo, cloth. 3/6 net.</i></p>

<p>This life is by far the most interesting life of St. Paul yet
written. “Put yourself in his place,” is the note struck, and
this human note is sustained throughout. It brings out the
personal interest in the life of St. Paul, from his boyhood,
playing on the wharves of Tarsus, to the day when, a lonely
old saint of God, he laid down his tired life at the headsman’s
block in Rome and entered on his wonderful new
adventure in the Hereafter. A special feature is the attempt
made to place the epistles in their proper place in St. Paul’s
life, in which the author has been so successful that they
seem to form one harmonious whole.</p>
